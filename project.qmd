# Research Project Overview

Throughout the entire semester you will work with a co-author to analyze a data set and present the results of your research. Regular homework assignments will serve as a first draft of exploration into your research questions, and helps you build your story. However expect to visualize and analyze your data outside the those assignments.

You will build up your project in phases, revising multiple times. Here is the general outline, with each phase is explained in detail further below.

-   Phase 1: Data and Topic approval
-   Phase 2: Introduce your project and variables of interest
-   Phase 3: Explore your data and relationships
-   Phase 4: Analyze bivariate relationships
-   Phase 5: Multivariable modeling
-   Phase 6: Summarize Findings

# Deliverables

Your research team will produce two separate deliverables: a research poster and a report to be submitted to the [Journal of Math 615](journal.qmd).

### Poster / Poster prep slides

We will hold a Research Poster symposium during finals week for everyone to present their work.

You will be organizing your findings using a Google Slides template that will lead you through an organized approach to reporting research. This short format will also help you concisely explain your research findings in a way will be easier to translate (fit) onto a poster.

-   These slides stay in Google (are not submitted to Canvas) and are subject to the *mastery based assessment* discussed at the bottom of this page.
-   The contents of each slide are specified in the slide template and explained below.
    -   You are welcome to have "staging" slides where you can dump content, thoughts, analyses that you *may* end up using. **These extra slides should be at the END of the required slides.**
-   There are also [example slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JoRVyt_F4IqleTZFCnsPjOaFYDVNJPzP) from prior students as a references.

### Report

You will also submit a written a report to the internal [*Journal of Math 615*](journal.qmd). A small selection of projects from the course are published each semester, showcasing the range of topics and analytical approaches explored by our students.

See the [Guide for Authors](https://math615.netlify.app/author_guide.html) for more details.

### Peer Review

After selected phases your poster prep slides and written report will be submitted for feedback, peer review and scoring. It is expected that you revise your work after each set of reviews. Peer reviews of the written report will be done in Canvas using a scoring rubric. Peer reviews of the poster prep slides will occur as comments in google slides.

Identify a research partner, propose a research topic and corresponding data set.

Open source data repositories to peruse:

-   [Dr.D's curated data sets](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jULudBjRbHdW-uLIvmMbxRBEJJkq9crY) (start here)
-   [Data.gov](https://data.gov/)
-   [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/)

-   The [All of Us](https://www.researchallofus.org/) Research Hub stores health data from participants from across the United States
-   Other?

‚ùå Sources not allowed: Machine learning repositories such as Kaggle or UCI. Data generated from experimental lab designs with few variables.

::: callout-important
#### Criteria for choosing a data set

-   You either know something about the topic or it is something you want to learn about
-   File type must be a .txt, .csv, .xlsx or .xls file
-   File size is less than 1 Gig
-   A codebook or data dictionary that fully explains what each variable means is available.
-   There are at least 200 rows (observations), but ideally between 500-10,000.
-   There are 10 or more *unique* and interesting variables
    -   At least 4 quantitative variables
    -   Variables are not functions of each other (e.g. weight in lbs and weight in kg)
:::

Your data set must be approved before you are allowed to work with it. First answer a few questions in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11rn2ZUjxOUQx3DY0N5gGuZG-4xGjYNLlObyOBOSgW78/edit?usp=drive_link). Then upload the data (a sample or a codebook will also be sufficient) to the [Project Phase 1 Google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjAm8k0_WPQO1BJRrj_U03cOq0nd7Ans?usp=drive_link). Name your data file with at least one author name

The sooner your data is approved the sooner you can work with it! If your proposed data set is turned down twice in a row get turned down, you will be required to use one of Dr. D's curated data sets.

## Phase 2: Introduce your research question and variables of interest

# Dissemination

## Research Poster

-   You will transfer all findings into a research poster, print the poster, and then present your research to your classmates during our class final period in a poster symposium format.
-   Full guidelines including examples and evaluation criteria [are written in this blog post](https://www.norcalbiostat.com/post/2022-11-26-poster-guidelines/).
-   Submit the poster file as printed to Canvas by the due date.

**Draft version**

This draft is graded based on how complete the poster is. You should consider this a draft that you would circulate to your colleagues for final review and comments. There is a rubric in Canvas with details.

Save your poster as a PDF and upload to the `Poster-Draft` folder in Google Drive.

**Final Version**

Upload your final poster as it is printed in PDF format Canvas.

**Presentation at the Poster Symposium**

When not presenting, you will walk around and learn about others research. Ask the presenters questions and fill out an evaluation form as you go. Poster scoring follows the above evaluation criteria and will be done via Google Forms. The link to this semesters form is in Canvas. Printed copies will be available upon request.

## Research Report

Following the [Guide for Authors](https://math615.netlify.app/author_guide.html) you will submit both the *self contained* HTML file and the PDF file to Canvas by the due date.

# üöß Project Grading Method

## Poster Preparation Slides

This work will be done through a series of revisions gaining feedback from the instructor at each phase.

-   Each slide will be marked one of the following categories
    -   `Not Aeesssible`: No content presented.
    -   `NR`: Needs revision. This is C level work.
    -   `ME`: Meets expectation. This is B level work.
    -   `E` : Exemplary. This is A level work.

### Rubric / Assessment form

Each team has their own 'project assessment' Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement Phase you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it. The Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for. At the bottom of this file you will find a personalized grading rubric containing an *estimate* of your final score.

I will update your status column for the slides that are being assessed at that Phase.

You can request a reassessment of prior work at (nearly) any time. (You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I'm reviewing slides.)

You are responsible for keeping track of your status and asking for reassessment.

## Research Report

The research report will be graded in Canvas using a rubric.
