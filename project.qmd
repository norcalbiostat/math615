title: "Research Project"
---

## Overview

Throughout the entire semester you will be analyzing a data set with the end goal of creating a poster presentation to present your research. Your assignments will serve as a first draft of exploration into your research questions, and helps you build your story. Homework assignments alone will not be sufficient for a good analysis. 

You will build up your project in stages, revising multiple times. The end goal is a research poster that you will present during finals week. You will be summarizing your findings using Google Slides. This will help you concisely explain your research topic and findings in a way will be easier to translate (fit) onto a poster. Here is the general outline, with each stage is explained in detail further below. 

* Stage 1: Choose a data set and identify a few research topics
* Stage 2: Introduce your project and variables of interest
* Stage 3: Explore your data and relationships
* Stage 4: Analyze bivariate relationships
* Stage 5: Multivariable modeling & summarizing findings
* Stage 6: Poster Creation & Presentation

## Peer Review

Stages 2-6 are subject to peer review. See the [help with peer review](help.html#peer-review) page for details.

Once you have addressed a particular piece of feedback mark it as "resolved" in Google Slides. 

:warning: *Do Not Delete Feedback until notified that it is okay*
:::

### General Notes

* At each reviewed stage you should update anything you need to change based on feedback, such as correctly making graphics, writing results correctly etc. 
* There is a [slide deck template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M98PL_S1TzHjXs00Ir86imfr1mO801tyWawk30RH0r4) and some example slides from prior students in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JoRVyt_F4IqleTZFCnsPjOaFYDVNJPzP). 
    - The template has more details about the contents of each slide and guidance for what should be included on that slide. 
* The contents of each slide are specified below. 
    - You are welcome to have "staging" slides where you can dump content, thoughts, analyses that you _may_ end up using. **These extra slides should be at the END of the required slides.**

## Dr. D's interpretation of your research

I will be using [this Google file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10O0Fasbpo_3KgC5Z7-P4YDAnZu70bYn_WFPR6vRX4O0) to summarize your research progress as I do my reviews. I may ask you to review it and address critical questions.

## Grading Method
This project overall is worth 30% of your grade. Instead of assigning specific points to each stage and adding up the points for an overall score, this work will be done through a series of revisions gaining feedback from both your peers and the instructor at each stage. 

* Instead of a point number, for each item to be assessed (currently each slide) you will be marked as either "needing revision", "meeting expectation", or "exemplary". .  
* See the [Assessment Rubric here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7hhnF8hwr1rJ5VTfolkx12fh3IjW5gSRh4GvK3j7Jw)
* I will update your status column for the slides that are being assessed at that stage. 
    - I will also check on any prior slides that are at 'needs revision' stage. 
* You can request a reassessment of prior work at (nearly) any time. (You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I'm reviewing slides.)

## Rubric under construction
This is a method of 'ungrading' that I have been wanting to try for a while. At the math congress (camping conference) I attended the first week of October a math educator discussed this method with us and so I was inspired to finally test it out. This project is a perfect opportunity to do so. 

This means that the Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. Right now they are slightly modified from the old grading rubric. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for. 

Each person has their own 'project assessment' Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement stage you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it. 
:::

#### ... but points!??
In the end this still has to be converted to a point value/letter grade right? So here's how I'm going to do it. The project makes up 110 points out of the total pts for the class. 

* If you have $\geq$ 90% of assessment items at 'exemplary' and none at 'needs revision', that's "A" work and you get the full 110 pts. 
* If you have $\geq$ 90% of assessment items at 'meets expectation' and no more than 1 at 'needs revision', that's "B" work and you get 95 pts. Note 'meeting expectation' does not correspond to _A_ level work
* If you have $\geq$ 80% of assessment items at 'meets expectation' and no more than 2 at 'needs revision', that's "C" work and you get 80 pts. 

This is a graduate level class, so anything below a C is considered not passing. I don't expect anyone to be at that stage by the end of the semester. 



## Stage 1: Choose a data set and identify a few research topics

* Project data you can choose from can be found in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jULudBjRbHdW-uLIvmMbxRBEJJkq9crY). 
* Browse through the available data sets, read the summaries and skim the codebooks.
* Add your name to [Dr D's summary of your research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10O0Fasbpo_3KgC5Z7-P4YDAnZu70bYn_WFPR6vRX4O0) once you have chosen a topic.
* Download the data and codebook to your `Math615/data` folder. 
* You will work through writing out a few research questions as part of Homework 02. 

:::{.callout-caution icon=false collapse="true"}
## But what about my thesis research?

Under only very strict certain circumstances I will allow for graduate thesis data to be used. You must make an appointment to meet with me to go over your data, codebook and research question for this to be a consideration.
:::


## Stage 2: Introduce your research question and variables of interest

* Create a Google Slides presentation directly into the `Project -00 Poster prep` folder in our Google Drive. 
* Name your file using your username only. 
* The [Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M98PL_S1TzHjXs00Ir86imfr1mO801tyWawk30RH0r4) has more details and specific guidance for what should be included on each slide (similar to below)
* There are also [example slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JoRVyt_F4IqleTZFCnsPjOaFYDVNJPzP) from prior students as a references. 

These slides are pale yellow in the template. 

* **Slide 01**. Title 
* **Slide 02**. Introduction 
* **Slide 03**. Background & lit review. 
* **Slide 04**. Explain the research problem / topic area
* **Slide 05**. State your Research Question as a testable hypothesis. 
* **Slide 06**. Introduce the data. Where does it come from, how was it collected. How many records? 
* **Slide 07**. Description of measures (variables) being used. 


:::{.callout-warning}
## Pay attention to slide Numbers!

* Please ensure that all content is on the slide as expected. 
* Slides will not be filled in in direct numerical order.
* Check the template if you are confused. I have added slide background coloring to help you keep you on track

:::


## Stage 3: Exploratory data analysis 

These slides are pale blue in the template. 
   
* **Slide 09**. Fully describe your primary response variable
* **Slide 10**. Fully describe your primary explanatory variable
* **Slide 11**. Fully describe the relationship between your primary explanatory and primary response variables
* **Slide 13**. Fully describe the relationship of a third variable to either your explanatory or response variables

All using appropriate summary statistics, graphic and an explanatory sentence. 


## Stage 4: Bivariate Inference 

These slides are pale purple in the template. 

* **Slide 08**. Describe in a few sentences what analysis tools you will use to answer your research question
* **Slide 12**. Analyze the relationship discussed in slides 11
* **Slide 14**. Analyze the relationship discussed in slides 13

* This should be a conclusion written in English, in the contenxt of the problem, includes summary statistics, confidence interval and a p-value. 


## Stage 5: Multivariable modeling & summarizing findings

You are trying to understand the relationship between your explanatory and response variable, in presence of information contained in other variables. 

These slides are pale green in the template. 

**Slide 15: Testing for categorical moderator**

* Create a graph to assess if a separate categorical variable is a moderator
* Include appropriate summary statistics for the bivariate relationship under consideration for each level of the potential moderator
* Explain in a sentence or two if this new variable is or is not a moderator, using summary numbers and explicit features of the graph to justify your conclusion


**Slide 16: Testing for confounding relationships**

* Present the regression analysis results with and without a confounder. 
* Explain whether or not the variable under consideration is a confounder or not. Use the confounding assignment to guide the written results.  
* Explain whether or not the additional variable helped improve prediction of response variable. 

**Slide 17: Results from a Multivariable Model**

* Build a multivariable model by adding additional predictors to the model. 
    - See the lecture notes on model building as guidance. 
    - Include any variables that were found to be significantly associated with the outcome
    - If you found a moderator, your model should include an interaction term with your moderating variable.
* A table or a graphic of the regression coefficients (or Odds Ratios) must be presented. 
    - Make tables in Excel or Powerpoint directly. Do not copy R output
* At least one coefficient, the primary explanatory variable, must be interpreted in context of the problem. 


**Slide 18. Discussion**

* Here you will explain what your graphical and inferential results tell you about your topic.
* Discuss if your research hypothesis was supported, if it was not, why you think that might be
* Explain the overall story/trend/what you learned when you consider your univariate, bivariate & multivariate results about your topic.
* Compare your results to previous research results. Do they agree or disagree? 

**Slide 19. Implications**

* What are the practical implications of your results?
* What could others do with your findings? 
* What future research needs to be conducted?
    - This needs to be more specific than "other variables could be explored". Which variables and why? What other research articles indicate that those other variables are relevant? 

**Slide 20. Limitations**

* Who are the results of this study generalizable to? (i.e. a subset of individuals?)
* Were there any model assumptions that were not upheld? 
* If this is an observational study, you should make a statement about the findings are associations and not causal in nature
* Are there other factors that could explain your response variable that you did not include in your model? 


**Slide 21. References**  

* You can use smaller font to get all references on one slide.
* Use references from research plan, and any additional references gathered along the way. 
* Make sure these are correctly done in APA format.
* Proper citations for 
    - [Add Health](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/faqs/addhealth#how-do-i-cite-the-add-health-contractual-data-)
    - *R*: Type `citation()`
    - [R Studio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206212048-Citing-RStudio)

## Stage 6: Posters Presentations

:::{.callout-important}
# REVISIONS NEEDED HERE
The content below needs to be revised for Fall 22
:::


* You will transfer all findings into a research poster, print the poster, and then present your research to your classmates. 
    - We will split the class in half. When not presenting, you will be scoring the other half of the class's posters. 
* Posters can be in powerpoint (the standard format for research posters), or Google Slides (once appropriately sized)
    - Regardless of the file type, you must use a template. Do not try to reinvent the wheel. 

### Poster Guidelines
https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/poster_guidelines/ 

  * Links to poster templates, 
  * Details on what each section should contain
  * Guidance on aesthetics and printing (when appropriate)
  * Evaluation criteria
  * Examples of professional and prior student work. 


### Draft version

* This draft is graded on how complete the poster is. You should consider this a draft that you would circulate to your colleagues for final review and comments. 
* Use the [evaluation criteria](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/poster_guidelines/#evaluation-criteria) as a guide for what I am looking for.
*  **This assignment is graded in Blackboard using a rubric** - be sure to look at this before you submit. 
    - Points are awarded based off how close to presentation quality your poster is by the time the draft is due. 
    - Basically the more work I think you need to put into your poster to make it presentable, the lower the points you get for the draft. 


**Submission and Peer Review Instructions**

* Save your poster as a PDF and upload to the `Google Drive/Project Poster Drafts` folder. 
* To conduct your peer review, open the PDF from Google Drive directly in your browser. 
    - Use the comment feature to write the comments directly into the poster file itself. 
    - provide at least two specific comments for each
        - something that can be improved
        - something that is good
    

### Final Version

* Upload your final poster (as printed) to the `Google Drive/Project Poster Final Version` folder. 
    - PDF preferred. PPTX ok.
* Scoring will be done via [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/oFMQ2hqtthZFPq7T7). It looks exactly like the [evaluation criteria](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/poster_guidelines/#evaluation-criteria).
    - When not presenting, you will walk around and learn about others research. Ask them questions, fill out the evaluation on your phone as you go. Printed copies will be available upon request so you can submit later. 
* The final grade will be determined by
    - Base score = **30%** student score + **70%** instructor score **+ bonus pts** for best in show awards **- 1** point penalty for each day late.
