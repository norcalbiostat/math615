The *Journal of MATH 615* is the official internal publication of the Data Analysis for Graduate Research course at California State University at Chico. It serves as a platform for sharing high-quality student research in applied statistics and data analysis. A small selection of top-graded projects from the course are published each semester, showcasing the range of topics and analytical approaches explored by our students. Submitting to the journal gives students hands-on experience in preparing a manuscript, following professional publication guidelines, and clearly communicating statistical results. This process helps strengthen research writing skills and prepares students for future academic or professional work.

See the [Guide for authors](author_guide.qmd) for details on how to submit to this journal.
