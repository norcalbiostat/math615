## Logistics

### When can I get help outside of class? 
The landing page of this website shows the times I am available for drop in student office hours, and community coding. There is also a link to book an appointment if none of those times work for you. 

This is when you can come talk to me about the course material, the subject in general, or life. These are my hours that I dedicate specifically to helping you. Use them! I am here to help you. 



### How do I use Discord?

> NOTE: You will be/have joined the Math & Stats server. You do not need to create one of your own. 


### How can I submit feedback? 
I want to make this class a welcome learning opportunity for everyone. I welcome your comments and constructive critique. What I do not welcome is flaming, trolling or insults. Here are some examples of appropriate uses of this feedback form. 

1) Class activities. What should I start doing, stop doing, and keep doing? Is the pace too fast? To slow?
2) Topics: Is there something specific you would like brought up in class, but don't want to be the one to bring it up?
3) Flagging the Misfires. I am bound to make mistakes and microaggressions regarding culture, religion, gender, and diversity. Helping you feel safe is a real-time pursuit. If my remarks created discomfort, you can use this form to voice the concern quickly rather than saving it for the course evaluation months later.
4) Words of Encouragement. I need positive feedback to keep me recharged!

## Software

### Community Coding

* The [Data Science Initiative](https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/) offers year-round training workshops and seminars on data-science related topics including R.
* [Community Coding](https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/community-coding.shtml) (CC): Students, staff, faculty, and the public are invited to join the Community Coding sessions. Bring your computer, coding projects, and your questions to this open working environment. Think of CC as additional office hours where you have access to more teachers than just me.
    - I highly recommend making a habit to attend CC at minimum to do your homework in a supportive environment. 
    
### R, R Studio, R Markdown/Quarto

## Assignments

### How do I complete the assignments? 

Most homework assignments will come with a template to use. This will be a Quarto (`*.qmd`) file for R users, and a Word document (`*.doc`) for SPSS users. 

R users write their code and answers directly into the `.qmd` file. SPSS users will copy their code and relevant output into the Word doc, along with writing their answers in the Word doc directly. 

All homework files must be compiled or converted to PDF before submission. R users `render` their file to PDF, SPSS users will `save as` their Word document as PDF. 

Links to the templates can be found in the homework assignment itself. A list of all assignment files can be found on the [Assignments](assignments.html) page. 
    
### How/where do I submit completed assignments? 

**Standard Assignments**

* Unless specified, all assignments are to be submitted be in PDF format to Canvas for scoring using a rubric.
* I will review and comment on each assignment, writing corrections and suggestions for improvement. 

**Project Assignments**

* These assignments will be completed in Google Drive directly and will be peer reviewed. 
* The project uses a _mastery based_ grading system that allows you to continue to refine your work until it reaches an acceptable level of quality. The details are described on the [Project](https://math615.netlify.app/project.html#grading-method) page.
* Project assignments should be considered quality work and such refined, reviewed, and absolutely spellchecked before submission. 


### What are you looking for when you grade? 

* Most assignments include examples directly in the assignment file itself. 
* Correct English grammer, spelling, formatting. 
* Concise, clear and complete answers. 
* Correct statistical methods used
* That you answered the question posed. 
* No extraneous output or code

## Peer Review

### Why do we do peer review? 

* Everyone has different thought processes and may have approached the question from a different perspective that can help you learn the material. 
* Co-authoring and reviewing your peers work is part of a professional research position. 
* Learning how to provide good feedback will make you a better collaborator
* This is a delayed version of paired programming - another set of eyeballs can typically help you find your mistake. 
* I have 10fold more assignments to review than you do. 
    - You'll get your peer's reviews back faster than I can get yours back.
    - The more eyes on your document the better. 
* I will be looking for different things than your peers will be. This is a good thing. They are looking from "untrained eyes", which can be very critical to make sure you are explaining yourself clearly. I can better "figure out" what you are meaning to say  - they are the ones that will best tell you when/where you need to explain your findings better. 
* You are expected to read your peer's feedback and revise your work before it is graded. 

### How do I review my peers work?

1. Check the Peer Review Rotation spreadsheet in Google Drive to see who you are scheduled to review. 
    - If one of your reviewees did not submit the assignment DM them in Discord first to see if they are just running a little late. If it's getting reasonably late then just pick another person to review that doesn't have a lot of comments so far and DM me to let me know. 
2. By using comment bubbles, provide feedback to your peers. 
    - Be specific. Give the type of feedback that you want to receive. 
    - Minimum **three** corrections or suggestions for improvement. 
3. :exclamation: Use the "guide for peer reviews" included in each assignment.  :star:


### Giving good feedback 

* Compliment the author. What did you like about their writing or plots? 
* Make specific suggestions regarding things like word choices, use of details, organization, topic
* Mark corrections such as spelling, grammar, punctuation, analysis methods, coding errors, but don't try to turn their paper or style into your style. 
* If you find a claim that is not supported by data in the document (or cited) be sure to point it out. 
* Check their work against what is required. Do they have all required elements?

### Grading of peer reviews

As I do my reviews on the same document, I will be reading and assessing your peer review. If I find your review is not providing quality feedback to the author you will not receive credit for that review. You may see the cells in the peer review spreadsheet changing color as I check off your review.  

## Class policies
