## Course Information

This course provides a hands-on introduction to using data to rigorously answer research questions. Students practice cleaning and manipulating data, creating data visualizations, and conducting introductory level statistical analysis using real-world data sets that are relevant to their field. Analysis topics include single and two-sample inference, analysis of variance, multiple regression, analysis of co-variance, experimental design, repeated measures, nonparametric procedures, and categorical data analysis. Reproducible research is strongly emphasized through the use of statistical computing software (e.g. SPSS, Stata, SAS, R, Python). Recommended for all majors that use data for research.
