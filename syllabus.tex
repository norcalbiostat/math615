\section{Course Information}\label{course-information}}

\emph{This course provides a hands-on introduction to using data to
rigorously answer research questions. Students practice cleaning and
manipulating data, creating data visualizations, and conducting
introductory level statistical analysis using real-world data sets that
are relevant to their field. Analysis topics include single and
two-sample inference, analysis of variance, multiple regression,
analysis of co-variance, experimental design, repeated measures,
nonparametric procedures, and categorical data analysis. Reproducible
research is strongly emphasized through the use of statistical computing
software (e.g.~SPSS, Stata, SAS, R, Python). Recommended for all majors
that use data for research. 3 hours discussion.}

\section{Pre-requisite statistics
Knowledge}\label{pre-requisite-statistics-knowledge}}

This class requires a recent statistics course such as Math 105, Math
315 or Math 350. Sometimes you need a refresher on the content that was
covered in those classes (such as how to summarize data, probability,
distributions). While we will be going over all the basic visualizations
and tests again, it will be fast and the emphasis is on interpretation
and proper use in research.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Chapter 6 in the PMA6 textbook contains an overview on how to select
  appropriate summary measures, graphs (also in chapter 4), and analysis
  methods. (we'll go through this chapter)
\item
  The \href{https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/}{Intro to Modern
  Statistics} book can help with this (this is a free required textbook)
\item
  I also like the \href{https://leanpub.com/os}{OpenIntro Statistics}
  book (also available as a free pdf) chapters 1-4.
\end{itemize}

Items that you need to know reasonably well are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  types of data (categorical, quantitative, numerical, qualitative)
\item
  appropriate plot types depending on types of data (histogram vs bar
  chart)
\item
  measures of center (mean, median, mode)
\item
  measures of spread (standard deviation, standard error, IQR, range)
\end{itemize}

Items that you need to know at least a little about

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  rules of basic probability (e.g.~is between 0 and 1, disjoint/mutually
  exclusive)
\item
  the normal distribution: Z-scores (how to calculate, how to interpret)
  and probability under the curve (one-tail, two tail)

\hypertarget{what-am-i-graded-on}{%
\subsection{What am I graded on?}\label{what-am-i-graded-on}}

I care both that you are keeping up with the material, but also that by
the end of the term you can conduct your own personalized analysis on a
new data set. Here is how I check in on your progress throughout the
semester

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Quizzes} on the current or prior content. Quizzes are a great
  way to test yourself, enhance recall, and self-assess your
  comprehension of the subject. Quizzes are administered in Google
  Forms, and done in two parts.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Individual}: First try to answer as many questions without
    looking at your notes. Then use your notes to answer the rest.
  \item
    \textbf{Group}: After the individual quiz closes I will choose 1-4
    questions that scored the lowest. We will do a class-wide discussion
    of those topics, then you will work in groups to redo the selected
    questions for half credit.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Assignments} This is your testing ground, your first round of
  practice. Can you take what you learned and apply it to a data set.
  Lots of feedback, graded on completeness and effort.
\item
  \textbf{Peer reviews} Helping others enhances your own understanding.
\item
  \textbf{Project} Can you weave together data and story to do research?
  This is your second round of practice. Your work should be more
  polished than in your homework, and I will be grading them in more
  detail and using a rubric.
\item
  \textbf{Final Exam} Can you analyze a new data set to answer a
  research question and write a professional report on your results?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{okay-but-what-about-the-points}{%
\subsection{Okay, but what about the
points?}\label{okay-but-what-about-the-points}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The gradebook in Canvas contains columns for all graded materials with
  point values and rubrics.
\item
  The project uses a \emph{mastery based} grading system that allows you
  to continue to revise your work until it reaches an acceptable level
  of quality. The details are described on the
  \href{https://math615.netlify.app/project.html\#grading-method}{Project}
  page.
\item
  See
  \href{https://math615.netlify.app/help.html\#grading-of-peer-reviews}{here}
  for info on grading peer reviews.
\end{itemize}

Your final grade will be displayed as a running total in Canvas. The
grades are weighted by category as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assignments: 30\%
\item
  Quizzes: 20\%
\item
  Participation: 10\%\\
\item
  Take home Final exam: 10\%
\item
  Project related assignments: 30\%
\end{itemize}

I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90\%: A, 89-80\%: B, 79-70\%: C.

\hypertarget{everyone-is-welcome-here}{%
\subsection{Everyone is welcome here}\label{everyone-is-welcome-here}}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity
of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities
(including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To
help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from
  those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to
  call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want
  to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as
  accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I
  can do to honor your name.
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
  your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
  talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
  also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the
  schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a
  general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your
  concerns).
\item
  If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office
  of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
  530-898-4764, and email
  \href{mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}{\nolinkurl{diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}}
\item
  I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse
  perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
  anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
  (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).
\end{itemize}

\emph{Adapted from
\href{https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements}{Monica
Linden at Brown University}}.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on
lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area,
the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with
this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our
campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda
people for centuries.

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\subsection{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to
miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason,
PM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms
  \textbf{DO NOT COME TO CLASS}. DM me in Discord we'll make a backup
  plan.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsection{Late work}\label{late-work}}

I don't penalize for late work, but I prioritize on time submissions. If
you submit an assignment after i'm done grading everyone elses, and
we're moving on to the next topic then your assignment may have to wait
a week before I can get back to it. That is likely to negatively impact
your ability to move forward and to get feedback in time.

There are exceptions for when your work is peer reviewed. There is no
grace period for peer reviews. You must be responsible and timely for
your colleagues.

\hypertarget{collaboration}{%
\subsection{Collaboration}\label{collaboration}}

Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when
they have someone else to talk through concepts with.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm, colframe=quarto-callout-warning-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-warning-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, colback=white, coltitle=black, arc=.35mm, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, bottomrule=.15mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-warning-color}{\faExclamationTriangle}\hspace{0.5em}{Warning}, toprule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, opacityback=0]

Collaboration on exams is not allowed.

\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{use-of-ai}{%
\subsection{Use of AI}\label{use-of-ai}}

As an instructor I recognize there are a variety of AI programs
available to assist in creating text and writing code. However, I want
to stress that, AI programs are not a replacement for human creativity,
originality, and critical thinking. Writing (text and code) is a skill
that you must nurture over time in order to develop your own individual
voice, style, and view.

The use of chat GPT is allowed/encouraged \textbf{to help you learn how
to code} but all code used must be fully explained in text. We will
cover what this means and how to do this when we start data management
around week 3.
\href{https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code/}{How
ChatGPT can help you write code}

You are responsible for fact checking the accuracy of statements
composed by AI language models.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white, bottomtitle=1mm, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, colback=white, coltitle=black, arc=.35mm, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, bottomrule=.15mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Be up front!}, toprule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, opacityback=0]

When presenting text written by Artificial intelligence (AI) language
models, such as ChatGPT, you must include an appropriate citation.
\url{https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt}

This also goes for when you have it write code for you. You need to
indicate when and where you used it.

\end{tcolorbox}

Any use outside of this permission constitutes a violation of Chico
State's Integrity Policy and may result in you being reported to the
Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities.

\subsection{Academic Integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Academic integrity is defined as ``a commitment, even in the face of
adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness,
respect, and responsibility''. From these values flow principles of
behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action.
Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or
plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at
https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions
about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating
academic integrity.
