\section{Course Information}\label{course-information}}

\emph{This course provides a hands-on introduction to using data to
rigorously answer research questions. Students practice cleaning and
manipulating data, creating data visualizations, and conducting
introductory level statistical analysis using real-world data sets that
are relevant to their field. Analysis topics include single and
two-sample inference, analysis of variance, multiple regression,
analysis of co-variance, experimental design, repeated measures,
nonparametric procedures, and categorical data analysis. Reproducible
research is strongly emphasized through the use of statistical computing
software (e.g.~SPSS, Stata, SAS, R, Python). Recommended for all majors
that use data for research. 3 hours discussion.}

\subsection{Everyone is welcome here}\label{everyone-is-welcome-here}}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity
of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities
(including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To
help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from
  those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to
  call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want
  to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as
  accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I
  can do to honor your name.
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
  your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
  talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
  also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the
  schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a
  general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your
  concerns).
\item
  If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office
  of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
  530-898-4764, and email
  \href{mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}{\nolinkurl{diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}}
\item
  I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse
  perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
  anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
  (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).
\end{itemize}

\emph{Adapted from
\href{https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements}{Monica
Linden at Brown University}}.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on
lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area,
the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with
this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our
campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda
people for centuries.

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\subsection{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to
miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason,
PM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms
  \textbf{DO NOT COME TO CLASS}. DM me in Discord we'll make a backup
  plan.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsection{Late work}\label{late-work}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You should strive to submit on time for all draft items the sake of
  your peers. Do you want your reviews back in a timely manner? You
  should show them the same courtesy and professionalism.
\item
  I don't penalize for late work, but I prioritize on time submissions.
  If you submit an assignment after i'm done grading everyone elses, and
  we're moving on to the next topic then your assignment may have to
  wait a week before I can get back to it.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{collaboration}{%
\subsection{Collaboration}\label{collaboration}}

Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when
they have someone else to talk through concepts with.

The CSU requires students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against

While Chico State has relaxed its stance on mask mandates, for your and
my health and safety I \emph{request} that everyone wear an appropriate
face mask covering the nose and mouth while in class.

Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or
your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or
mandate may result in disciplinary action against you through the office
of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include
suspension or expulsion from the California State University system.

share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University.
Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the

\subsection{Academic Integrity}\label{academic-integrity}}

Academic integrity is defined as ``a commitment, even in the face of
adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness,
respect, and responsibility''. From these values flow principles of
behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action.
Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or
plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at
https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions
about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating
academic integrity.
