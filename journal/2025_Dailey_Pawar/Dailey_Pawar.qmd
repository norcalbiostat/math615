# Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between the explanatory variables of soil water content (SWC) and Temperature with the response variable Ecosystem Respiration (RECO) within the blue oak savanna ecosystem of Tonzi Ranch, California, spanning 2000-2021. Data were sourced from an AmeriFlux tower, capturing a variety of weather variables. After aggregating the observations to monthly means, and shifting RECO back 2 months temporally, we found a linear relationship between RECO and soil water content with a bivariate model, and a statistically significant relationship between RECO and a combination of SWC and temperature.
