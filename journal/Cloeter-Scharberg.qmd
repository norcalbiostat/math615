# Abstract
The sagebrush ecosystem is one of the most at-risk ecosystems in the United States. Sagebrush ecosystem degradation has mostly been attributed to human disturbances, invasive plants, and woody plant encroachment. These hydrological impacts in sagebrush ecosystems are attributed to the change in vegetation structure and alterations in the ecosystemâ€™s fire regime. Soil hydrophobicity is one hydrologic characteristic that is influenced by these changes. This analysis seeks to clarify the effect of tree-removal treatments and fire on soil hydrophobicity in a woodland-encroached sagebrush ecosystem.
