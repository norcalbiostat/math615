## Opening Remarks

The PMA6 textbook (Chapter 7) goes into great detail on this topic,
since regression is typically the basis for all advanced models.

The book also distinguishes between a "fixed-x" case, where the values
of the explanatory variable $x$ only take on pre-specified values, and a
"variable-x" case, where the values of $x$ are observations from a
population distribution of X's.

This latter case is what we will be concerning ourselves with.

## Bivariate distribution {.smaller}

The *bivariate distribution* describes how of $X$ and $Y$ are jointly
distributed, and is best interpreted by a look at the scatter diagram.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: 'center'
y.bar <- mean(pen$bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)
x.bar <- mean(pen$body_mass_g, na.rm=TRUE)

p <- ggplot(pen, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=bill_length_mm)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = y.bar) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = x.bar) 
ggExtra::ggMarginal(p, type="histogram")
```

If $X$ and $Y$ come from independent normal distributions, the pair
$(X,Y)$ comes from a *bivariate normal distribution*, and the data will
tend to cluster around the means of $X$ and $Y$.

## Ellipse of concentration

We can view the *ellipse of concentration* as measure of strength and
direction of the correlation between X and Y.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: 'center'
ggpubr::ggscatter(pen, x = "body_mass_g", y = "bill_length_mm",
   ellipse = TRUE, mean.point = TRUE,
   star.plot = TRUE)
```

See PMA6 Figure 7.5 for more examples.

## Correlation

The **correlation coefficient** is designated by $r$ for the sample
correlation, and $\rho$ for the population correlation. The correlation
is a measure of the strength and direction of a *linear relationship*
between two variables.

The correlation ranges from +1 to -1. A correlation of +1 means that
there is a perfect, positive linear relationship between the two
variables. A correlation of -1 means there is a perfect, negative linear
relationship between the two variables. In both cases, knowing the value
of one variable, you can perfectly predict the value of the second.


## Reminder to visualize your data before analysis

![These all have the same r value](images/ansQtet.png){fig-align="center"}


## Strength of the correlation

Here are rough estimates for interpreting the strengths of correlations
based on the magnitude of $r$.

-   $|r| \geq 0.7$: Very strong relationship
-   $0.4 \leq |r| < 0.7$: Strong relationship
-   $0.3 \leq |r| < 0.4$: Moderate relationship
-   $0.2 \leq |r| < 0.3:$ Weak relationship
-   $|r| < 0.2:$ Negligible or no relationship

## As a measure of model fit

When we square $r$ (i.e. $R^{2}$), it tells us what proportion of the
variability in one variable that is described by variation in the second
variable.

\

Yes, this is mathematically the same as the coefficient of determination
we saw in ANOVA.

## Pearson test of correlation

To test for a *linear* correlation between two variables we use the
**Pearson correlation coefficient** which is defined as the covariance
of the two variables divided by the product of their standard
deviations.

$$
\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_{x}\sigma_{Y}}
$$

There are many modifications and adjustments to this measure that we
will not get into detail with. We are using correlation as a stepping
stool to Linear Regression.

## Example: Body mass and bill length of penguins

### 1. Identify response and explanatory variables

-   The quantitative explanatory variable is body mass (g)
-   The quantitative response variable is bill length (mm)

## 2. Visualize and summarise 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
ggplot(pen, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(col = "red")
cor(pen$body_mass_g, pen$bill_length_mm, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
There is a strong, positive, mostly linear relationship between the body
mass (g) of penguins and their bill length (mm) (r=.595).
:::
:::

## 3.  Write the null and research hypothesis in words and symbols. {.smaller}

-   Null Hypothesis: There is no correlation between the body mass and
    bill length of penguins.
-   Alternate Hypothesis: There is a correlation between the body mass
    and bill length of penguins.

Let $\rho$ be the true correlation between body mass and bill length of penguins.

$H_{0}: \rho=0 \qquad \qquad H_{A}: \rho \neq 0$

## 4. State and justify the analysis model. Check assumptions. 

* Pearsons test of correlation will be conducted. This is appropriate
because both variables are quantitative. 
* The relationship between variables are reasonably linear
* The sample size is large.

## 5. Conduct the test

And make a decision about the plausibility of the alternative hypothesis. 

```{r}
cor.test(pen$body_mass_g, pen$bill_length_mm)
```

The p-value is very small, there is evidence in favor of a non-zero
correlation.

## 6. Write a conclusion in context of the problem. 

There was a statistically significant and strong correlation between the
body mass (g) and bill length (mm) of penguins (r = 0.595, 95%CI
.5220-.6595, p \< .0001). The significant positive correlation shows
that as the body mass of a penguin increases so does the bill length.
These results suggest that 35% (95% CI: 27.2-43.5) of the variance in
bill length can be explained by the body mass of the penguin.
