## Motivation - Ex. 1 {.smaller}

Below are the admissions figures for Fall 1973 at UC Berkeley.

|       | Applicants | Admitted |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Total | 12,763     | 41%      |
| Men   | 8,442      | 44%      |
| Women | 4,321      | 35%      |

: Table of admissions rates at UC Berkeley in 1973

Is there evidence of gender bias in college admissions? Do you think a difference of 35% vs 44% is too large to be by chance?

## Department specific data {.smaller}

|------------|------------|----------|------------|----------|------------|----------|
|            | All        |          | Men        |          | Women      |          |
| Department | Applicants | Admitted | Applicants | Admitted | Applicants | Admitted |

| D          | 792        | 34%      | 417        | 33%      | 375        | **35%**  |

| Total      | 4526       | 39%      | 2691       | 45%      | 1835       | 30%      |

: The table of admissions rates for the 6 largest departments show a different story.

After adjusting for features such as size and competitiveness of the department, the pooled data showed a "small but statistically significant bias in favor of women"

## Motivation Ex. 2

Can we predict penguin body mass from the flipper length?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
ggscatter(pen, x="flipper_length_mm", y = "body_mass_g", add = "reg.line", 
          color = "island", ellipse = TRUE)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Probably, but the relationship between flipper length and body mass changes depending on what island they are found on.
:::
:::

# Moderation {.smaller}

Moderation occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The third variable is referred to as the moderating variable or simply the moderator.
-   The moderator affects the direction and/or strength of the relationship between the explanatory ($x$) and response ($y$) variable.
-   So we need a model that can allow for this difference in slope.

:::

# Stratification {.smaller}

Stratified models fit the regression equations (or any other bivariate analysis) for each subgroup of the population.

The mathematical model describing the relationship between body mass ($Y$), and flipper length ($X$) for each of the species separately would be written as follows:

$$ Y_{ib} \sim \beta_{0b} + \beta_{1b}*x_{i} + \epsilon_{ib} \qquad \epsilon_{ib} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}_{b})$$ 
$$ Y_{id} \sim \beta_{0d} + \beta_{1d}*x_{i} + \epsilon_{id} \qquad \epsilon_{id} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}_{c}) $$ 
$$ Y_{it} \sim \beta_{0t} + \beta_{1t}*x_{i} + \epsilon_{it} \qquad \epsilon_{it} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}_{t}) $$

where $b, d, t$ indicates islands *Biscoe, Dream* and *Torgersen* respectively.

## Stratification

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
### Benefits

-   In each model, the intercept, slope, and variance of the residuals can all be different.
    -   $Y_{ij} \sim \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}*x_{i} + \epsilon_{ij} \qquad \epsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}_{j})$
-   This is the unique and powerful feature of stratified models.
:::

::: callout-important
### Consequences

-   Each model is only fit on the amount of data in that particular subset.
-   Each model has 3 parameters that need to be estimated: $\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}$, and $\sigma^{2}$
    -   Total of 9 for the three models.
-   The more parameters that need to be estimated, the more data we need.

# Identifying a Moderator

When testing a potential moderator, we are asking the question whether there is an association between two constructs, **but separately for different subgroups within the sample.**

We consider 3 scenarios demonstrating how a third variable can modify the relationship between the original two variables.

## Significant --\> Non-Significant

-   Significant relationship at bivariate level
    -   We expect the effect to exist in the entire population
-   Within at least one level of the third variable the strength of the relationship changes
    -   P-value is no longer significant within at least one subgroup

## Non-Significant --\> Significant

-   Non-significant relationship at bivariate level
    -   We do not expect the effect to exist in the entire population
-   Within at least one level of the third variable the relationship becomes significant
    -   P-value is now significant within at least one subgroup

## Change in Direction of Association

-   Significant relationship at bivariate level
    -   We expect the effect to exist in the entire population
-   Within at least one level of the third variable the direction of the relationship changes
    -   Means change order, positive to negative correlation etc.

## What to look for

| ANOVA                                          | Chi-Square                                      | Regression                                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| $p$-value, $R^2$, means, density/boxplot | $p$-value, col percents, side by side barcharts | correlation coefficient ($r$), $p$-value, $\beta$ coefficients, $r$-squared, scatterplot |

Compare these values within each level of the potential moderator to the values in the overall model. 

## Example: ANOVA {.smaller}

Does sex modify the relationship between flipper length and species? 


::: {.panel-tabset}

## Overall 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
ggplot(pen, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=species, fill=species)) + 
      stat_slab(alpha=.5, justification = 0) +

      labs(x="Flipper Length (mm)", y = "Species", title = "Overall") + 
      theme(legend.position = "none")
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
Gentoo have the larger flipper length by far, then Chinstrap is similar to Adelie but a little larger.

## By Sex

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
pen %>% select(flipper_length_mm, species, sex) %>% na.omit() %>%
ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=species, fill=species)) + 
      stat_slab(alpha=.5, justification = 0) + 
      geom_boxplot(width = .2,  outlier.shape = NA) + 
      geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, height = 0.05) +
      stat_summary(fun="mean", geom="point", col="red", size=4, pch=17) + 
      theme_bw() + 
      labs(x="Flipper Length (mm)", y = "Species", title = "By Sex") + 
      theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
The pattern of distributions of flipper length by species seems the same for both sexes of penguin. Sex is likely _not_ a moderator.

P-value still <.0001 in each group, $R^2_{f}= 0.84, R^2_m = 0.82$. Same pattern.

## Conclusion
Sex is **not** a modifier, the relationship between species and flipper length is the same within male and female penguins.

## Example: Chi-Squared {.smaller}

Does gender modify the relationship between smoking and general health?

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
The proportion of smokers increases as the level of general health decreases.
:::

## By Gender

:::: {.columns}

## Conclusion
The relationship between smoking status and general health is significant in both the main effects and the stratified model. The distribution of smoking status across general health categories does not differ between females and males. Gender is **not** a moderator for this analysis.

The slope of the lowess line between virginica and versicolor  appear similar in strength, whereas the slope of the line for setosa is closer to zero.
