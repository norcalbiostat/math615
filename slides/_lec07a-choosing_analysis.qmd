## A unifying model framework {.smaller}

A good way to think about all statistical models is that the observed data comes from some true model with some random error.

> DATA = MODEL + RESIDUAL

-   The `MODEL` is a mathematical formula (like $y = f(x)$).
-   The formulation of the `MODEL` will change depending on the number of, and data types of explanatory variables.
-   One goal of inferential analysis is to explain the variation in our data, using information contained in other measures (the model). To minimize the unexplained, or `residual` error.

## Which model to use?

## Choosing Appropriate Analysis {.smaller}

This table shows which statistical analyses procedures are appropriate depending on the combination of explanatory (rows) and response (columns) variable. 


| Exp \\ Resp      | Binary              | **Categorical**                     | **Quantitative**                |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Binary**       | Chi-squared         | Chi-squared                         | T-Test, Linear Regression       |
| **Categorical**  | Chi-squared         | Chi-squared                         | ANOVA, Linear Regression        |
| **Quantitative** | Logistic Regression | *Multinomial or Ordinal Regression* | Correlation & Linear Regression |


See Table 6.2 in PMA6 for a more detailed table. 

## Why selection can be difficult

::: incremental
-   Classroom instruction tends to present methods in logical order from a learning perspective. Building from simple to more complex. Exposure to complex models limited.
-   Real life data often contain a mixture of data types, missing data and complex patterns. This can make the choice of analysis somewhat arbitrary at times.
-   Two trained statisticians presented with the same data will often approach the analysis from different perspectives, and may different analyses depending on what assumptions they are willing to make.
:::

## Not always clear {.smaller}

-   The primary assumption of most standard statistical procedures is that the records are independent of each other.
-   Often program evaluation relies on paired measurements before and after a certain exposure or treatment (pre-post).
    -   In this case, the approach is to calculate a pairwise difference for each individual and compare the average difference to 0 (any change vs no change).
-   For the purposes of this class, we will only concern ourselves with independent groups.

Repeated measures is a topic typically taught in MATH 456 (but also covered in Chapter 18 of PMA6)

## Everything is a linear model

* Most of the common statistical tests (including the ones we cover) are special cases of linear regression

## Additional References

PMA6 does not go over T-test, ANOVA or $\chi^{2}$ tests. To see more examples (with R code) and more mathematical detail see [Chapter 5 in the Applied Stats Course Notes](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/bivariate-analysis.html)
