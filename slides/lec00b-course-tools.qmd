## Class website

<div style="text-align:center">

https://math615.netlify.app/

-   Bookmark this page. You will be here a lot.
-   Contains details on weekly topics, links to notes, assignments and additional materials
-   Sometimes links will be broken. Typo's happen. Notify me via Discord and I'll get to it asap.

## Class Website - Topic view

* One page per Topic
* These correspond to Modules in Canvas
* Ties together what we have learned, with what we are going to learn
* States the learning objectives for that topic
* Links to all learning and assessment materials for this topic
* **MAIN PLACE FOR LINKS** I don't like to put links in multiple places because if I make an update then I have to remember to update all places, and that is error prone. 

## Class Website - Other tabs

* All slides, all homework
* Project overview & information
* Syllabus, help
* Reference materials

## Practical Multivariate Analysis - 6th Edition

-   The textbook is used for reading and learning content at a more in depth level than my overview slides.
-   This will be used in Math 456, and is an excellent reference guide for further learning. 
-   If you're curious, Afifi is a mentor of mine and invited me to participate. I used the 4th edition in grad school and really like teaching out of it. Royalties are about $100/year and is *not* why I require this text. 

## Canvas

-   Assignment submission
-   Grades
-   Schedule, calendar, Due dates
-   Recorded lectures

## Google Drive

-   Collaborative note taking
-   Quizzes (Individual, and Group)
-   Ongoing research project work

## Discord

-   Used for outside class discussions, meme sharing, homework help and general chatter.
-   Your first place to ask code and homework based questions
-   I will not answer most class-content based questions through email.
-   Download either the phone app or the desktop app (I use both). This is mandatory.
    -   Do not rely on remembering to log in via the web browser. You will miss important notifications.

## Lecture notes (slides)

-   Stand alone lecture notes like these.
-   Click on three lines in the bottom left to see options for exporting a copy in other formats. 

## Video

-   Posted in Canvas
-   Occasional pre-class learning content
-   I will also record most class sessions

## Statistcal Analysis Software

-   The programming language R (syntax)
-   Community written packages containing functions to do cool things
-   Not used by itself *in this class*

![](images/RStudio.png){fig-align="center" width="75"}

-   RStudio is the supportive working environment
-   Integrates with other tools such as Quarto, HTML and Python
-   R is accessed *from within* R Studio

You will download and install both as part of homework 0. 

## Closing Thoughts

* It may seem like a lot in the first week or two
* You will get used to it if you embrace it and view it as a learning opportunity
* If you fight it because it's not what you're used to, or are upset because there are "too many places to look", you are not in for a fun semester. 
* I am open to _constructive_ feedback about course material.
