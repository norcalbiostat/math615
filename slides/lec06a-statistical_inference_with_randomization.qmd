# Statistical Inference

(A.K.A Hypothesis Testing)

![https://xkcd.com/1478/](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/p_values.png)

## Statistical Inference

::: incremental
-   Primarily concerned with understanding and quantifying the uncertainty of parameter estimates.
-   Equations and details change depending on the setting, the foundations for inference are the same throughout all of statistics.
-   We start with a case studies designed to motivate the process of making decisions about research claims.
-   We formalize the process through the introduction of the hypothesis testing framework, which allows us to formally evaluate claims about the population.

## Variability in data 

::: incremental
* Sometimes the dataset at hand represents the entire research question.
* More often than not, the data have been collected to answer a research question about a larger group of which the data are a (hopefully) representative subset.
* One dataset will not be identical to a second dataset even if they are both collected from the same population using the same methods.

## Experiment time!

Split the class into two mutually exclusive groups: students who sit on the left side of the classroom and students who sit on the right side of the classroom.

## Could it be chance?

If $p_{L}$ represents the proportion of students who prefer to read books on screen who sit on the left side of the classroom and $p_{R}$ represents the proportion of students who prefer to read books on screen who sit on the right side of the classroom, would you be surprised if $p_{L}$ did not exactly equal $p_{R}$?

## Assumptions
If we do not think the side of the room a person sits on in class is related to whether they prefer to read books on screen, what assumption are we making about the relationship between these two variables (side of room and preferring to read books)?
:::

## Randomization 

To decide whether variability in data is due to 

- (1) the causal mechanism (the randomized explanatory variable in the experiment)
- (2) natural variability inherent to the data 

we set up a sham randomized experiment as a comparison. 

## "Sham" randomized experiment

* We assume that each observational unit (student) would have gotten the exact same response value (likes to read or not) regardless of the treatment level (side of the room). 
* By reassigning the treatments many many times, we can compare the actual experiment to the sham experiment. 

## Decision

If the actual experiment has **more extreme results** than any of the sham experiments, we are led to believe that it is the explanatory variable which is causing the result and not just variability inherent to the data.

## Statistical inference is the practice of making decisions and conclusions from data in the context of uncertainty. 

Errors do occur, just like rare events, and the dataset at hand might lead us to the wrong conclusion. While a given dataset may not always lead us to a correct conclusion, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur.
