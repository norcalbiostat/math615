## Motivation
Visualizing your data is hands down the most important thing you can learn to do. 

* Screen for data entry errors
* Out of range variables
* Mistakes in coding
* Violation of model assumptions

## Level of care depends on the audience {.smaller}

There are three main audiences in mind when creating data visualizations: 

1. For your eyes only (FYEO). These are quick and dirty plots, without annotation. Meant to be looked at once or twice. 
    - You'll create a TON of these. Don't spend a ton of time on them. 
    
. . . 

2. To share with others internally. These mostly need to stand on their own. Axes labels, titles, colors as needed, possibly captions.
    - You'll create a lot of these, and you'll get better with practice at adding necessary annotation without a lot of time
    
. . . 

3. Professional - Contains all bells and whistles needed to make it publication quality. 
    - You'll create very few of these, but they demand a lot of time, detail and thought. 


## Choosing Appropriate Visualization

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
<br>
<br>
It entirely depends on the data type. 
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

## 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Categorical**

* Summary Statistics: N, %
* Tables: Frequency & proportions
* Plots: Bar charts, (pie charts on occasion)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Continuous**

* Summary Statistics: 
  - A measure of center: mean or median
  - A measure of variability: standard deviation, range, IQR
* Plots: Histogram, density plot, boxplot, violin plot

## How to create graphs

* Similar to the data management section, after identifying what you want to do, you go look up how to do that thing. 
* Don't expect to remember the exact code yet, just know where to look up an example and copy from there
* copy/paste/pray
* Keep it simple until you get more comfortable.
