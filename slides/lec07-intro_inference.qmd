# Case study: Stents

## Observed data

Consider an experiment that examined whether implanting a stent in the brain of a patient at risk for a stroke helps reduce the risk of a stroke. The results from the first 30 days of this study are summarized in the following table.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
table(stent30$group, stent30$outcome) |> addmargins()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
table(stent30$group, stent30$outcome) |>  prop.table(margin=1) |>round(digits=2)
```
:::
:::

These results are surprising! The point estimate suggests that patients who received stents may have a higher risk of stroke: $p_{trmt}âˆ’p_{ctrl}=0.090$.

## Point estimate vs Interval estimate

The point estimate for the difference in proportions $p_{trmt}âˆ’p_{ctrl}=0.090$ is a single point estimate, based on this single sample.

\

A *point estimate* is our best guess for the value of the parameter, so it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value.

## Constructing a 95% confidence interval (CI)

When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of interest about 95% of the time. Thus, a 95% confidence interval for such a point estimate can be constructed:

$$\mbox{point estimate} \pm 1.96 Ã— SE$$

We can be 95% confident this interval captures the true value.

## Construct a 95% CI for the stent example

The conditions necessary to ensure the point estimate $p_{trmt}âˆ’p_{ctrl}$ is nearly normal have been verified for you, and the estimate's standard error is $SE = 0.028$.

* Construct a 95% confidence interval for the change in 30-day stroke rates from usage of the stent.
* Interpret this interval in context of the problem. 

## Answer: 

$$0.090 \pm 1.96Ã—0.028 = (0.035,0.145)$$

We are 95% confident that implanting a stent in a stroke patientâ€™s brain increased the risk of stroke within 30 days by a rate of 0.035 to 0.145. 

## Important note

:warning: it's incorrect to say that we can be 95% confident that the true value is inside the mean. 

![Figure 13.11: Twenty-five samples of size n=300 were collected from a population with p=0.30. For each sample, a confidence interval was created to try to capture the true proportion p. However, 1 of these 25 intervals did not capture p=0.30.](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/95PercentConfidenceInterval-1.png)

## 

* This is one of the most common errors: while it might be useful to think of it as a probability, the confidence level only quantifies how plausible it is that the parameter is in the interval.
* Our intervals say nothing about the confidence of capturing individual observations, a proportion of the observations, or about capturing point estimates. 
* Confidence intervals provide an interval estimate for and attempt to capture population parameters.

## Using Confidence Intervals to test a hypothesis

This confidence interval can also be used in a way analogous to a hypothesis test: since the interval does not contain 0 (is completely above 0), it means the data provide convincing evidence that the stent used in the study changed the risk of stroke within 30 days
