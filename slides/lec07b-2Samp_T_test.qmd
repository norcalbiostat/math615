# Quantitative Outcome \~ Binary Covariate

-   Does knowing what group an observation is in tell you about the
    location of the data?
-   Are the means of **two** groups are *statistically* different from
    each other?

## Model

$$
y_{ij} = \mu_{j} + \epsilon_{ij} \qquad \qquad
\epsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2})
$$

-   Response data $y_{ij}$ from observation $i=1\ldots n$ belonging to
    group $j=1,2$
-   The random error terms $\epsilon_{ij}$ are independently and
    identically distributed (iid) as normal with mean zero and common
    variance.

## 2 sample T-test for difference in means between two independent groups {.smaller}

-   Parameter: $\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$
-   Estimate: $\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}$
-   Assumptions:
    -   Group 1 & 2 are mutually exclusive and independent
    -   Difference $\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}$ is normally distributed
    -   Variance within each group are approximately the same ($\sigma$)

$H_{0}: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = 0$: There is no difference in the averages
between groups.

$H_{A}: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} \neq 0$: There is a difference in the averages
between groups.

## Example: BMI vs smoking

We would like to know, is there convincing evidence that the average BMI
differs between those who have ever smoked a cigarette in their life
compared to those who have never smoked?

::: callout-important
## Nitty gritty detail

For the purposes of learning, you will be writing out each step in the
analysis in depth. As you begin to master these analyses, it is natural
to slowly start to blend and some steps. However it is important for you
to have a baseline reference.
:::

## 1. Identify response and explanatory variables

-   Ever smoker = binary explanatory variable (variable `eversmoke_c`)
-   BMI = quantitative response variable (variable `BMI`)

## 2. Visualize and summarise {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| fig-height: 5
plot.bmi.smoke <- addhealth %>% select(eversmoke_c, BMI) %>% na.omit()

plot.bmi.smoke %>% 
  ggviolin(x="eversmoke_c",
    y="BMI",
    color="eversmoke_c", 
    add = c("mean", "boxplot")) + 
  color_palette(palette = "jco") + xlab("Smoking Status")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
plot.bmi.smoke %>% 
  tbl_summary(
    by="eversmoke_c",
    digits = all_continuous() ~ 1,     
    statistic = list(
      all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})"
    ))
```
:::
:::

Smokers have on average BMI of 28.8, smaller than the average BMI of
non-smokers at 29.7. Non-smokers have more variation in their weights
(7.8 vs 7.3lbs), but the distributions both look normal, if slightly
skewed right.

## 3. Write the null and research hypothesis in words and symbols.

Let $\mu_{1}$ be the average BMI for smokers, and $\mu_{2}$ be the
average BMI for non-smokers 

\

$H_{0}: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = 0$ There is no difference in the average BMI between
    smokers and non-smokers. 
    
\

$H_{A}: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} \neq 0$ There is a difference in the average BMI
    between smokers and non-smokers.

## 4. State and justify the analysis model. Check assumptions. {.smaller}

* We are comparing the means between two independent samples. A **Two-Sample
T-Test for a difference in means** will be conducted. 
* The assumptions that the groups are independent is upheld because each individual can only be either a smoker or non smoker. 
* The difference in sample means $\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}$ is normally distributed - this is a valid assumption due to the large sample size and that differences typically are normally distributed. 
* The observations are independent, this was a random sample
* The variances are roughly equal (67/44 = 1.5 is smaller than 2).

## 5. Conduct the test and make a decision about the plausibility of the alternative hypothesis. {.smaller}

```{r}
t.test(BMI ~ eversmoke_c, data=addhealth)
```

There is strong evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The
interval for the differences (0.4, 1.3) does not contain zero and the
p-value = .0002.

## 6. Write a conclusion in context of the problem. Include the point estimates, confidence interval for the difference and p-value.

On average, non-smokers have a significantly higher 0.82 (0.39, 1.27)
BMI compared to smokers (p=.0002).

# Assumptions

Samples come from the same population

## Type I and Type II Error {.incremental}

-   AKA False positive or false negative.
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors)
-   The significance level, $\alpha$, is what we use to define the
    amount of "risk" we are willing to take to falsely reject $H_{0}$
    (false positive).
-   We talk more about false positive & false negative, [specificity and
    sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity)
    in Math 456.
-   We will see shortly however how to conduct multiple comparisons
    while maintaining our "family-wise" error rate at $\alpha$
