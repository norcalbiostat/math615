This page is dedicated to showing example code for selected tasks. 

```{r}
pen <- palmerpenguins::penguins
library(gtsummary)
library(tidyverse)
library(performance) # for check_model. You will also need to install the `see` package
# webshot2 -- You will have to install this package to use gtsave but don't need to load it
```

# Create Nice variable names

Select the variables of interest and rename them nicely using `select`. Note any name with a space in it has to be surrounded by a back tick (to the left of the 1 key)

```{r}
analysis.data <- 
  pen %>% 
  select(`Bill Depth (mm)` = bill_depth_mm, 
         `Bill Length (mm)` = bill_length_mm, 
         Sex = sex) %>%
  na.omit()
```


# Summarize a continuous variable across a categorical variable with many levels? 

:::{.callout-important}
#### Problem:
Sometimes the categorical variable has so many levels, or the level names are so long that the table wraps off the edge of the PDF and is unreadable. 

:::

```{r}
pen |> 
  tbl_summary(
  include = bill_length_mm,
  by = species
)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Solution

There is no easy way to rotate or "transpose" a gtsummary object. One approach is to manually use a "split-apply-combine" method.

1. we "map" a function `\()` across all levels of `pen$species` indexing by `s`
2. For `species` `s`, we create a `tbl_summary`
3. where we modify the header to have a common name of the numeric variable in question 
4. And change the label of the row to the species level `s`
5. Then we `stack` the tables together, and replace the `header` with the name of the Categorical variable
:::

```{r}
purrr::map(levels(pen$species), \(s)
  pen |>
    filter(species == s) |>
    tbl_summary(include = bill_length_mm, missing = "no") |>
    modify_header(all_stat_cols() ~ "**Bill length (mm)**") |>
    modify_table_body(~ mutate(.x, label = s))
  ) |>
  tbl_stack(group_header = NULL) |>
  modify_header(label ~ "**Species**")

```


Another approach is to use `dplyr` to `group_by` and `summarize`, then pass the data frame into `kable` from the `knitr` package to make a nicer table.

1. Create your summary statistics using `group_by` and `summarize`. 
2. Create a new variable as the column header, using back ticks to allow for a "non standard" variable name. 
3. Create this new variable by `paste`'ing the value of the mean and sd together with parenthesis, after rounding to 2 digits. 
4. `select` the variables you want to display
5. Pass it to `kable()`

```{r}
pen |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarize(mean=mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd = sd(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)) |>
  mutate(`Bill Length(mm)` = paste0(round(mean,2), " (", round(sd,2), ")")) |>
  select(Species= species, `Bill Length(mm)`) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

# Plots

## Export to a file

Make it look good first.

```{r}
ggplot(analysis.data, aes(x=`Bill Length (mm)`, 
                          y = `Bill Depth (mm)`, 
                          color = Sex)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw(base_size=18)
```

Then save. Import this into your poster file and adjust the width and height as needed.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(analysis.data, aes(x=`Bill Length (mm)`, 
                          y = `Bill Depth (mm)`, 
                          color = Sex)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw(base_size=18) 
  ggsave(filename = "myplot.png",  plot = get_last_plot(),
         width = 6, height = 6, units = "in")
```

## Remove a legend

```{r}
ggplot(pen, aes(x=island, fill = island)) + geom_bar() + 
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

# Regression model results

Make it look good first. 
```{r}
model <- lm(`Bill Depth (mm)` ~ `Bill Length (mm)` + Sex, data=analysis.data)

model %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(adj.r.squared, nobs)) 
```

Then add the code to export it as an image.

```{r}
#| eval: false
model %>%
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(adj.r.squared, nobs)) %>% 
  as_gt() %>%
  gt::gtsave(filename = "model_results.png", expand = 10)
```

## Resizing your output

Necessary to not make certain plots super squished. 

Without resizing.

```{r}
check_model(model) # from the performance package
```

Apply a code chunk option (`#|`) to resize the height

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| echo: fenced
check_model(model)
```
