Here is how I check in on your progress throughout the semester\n\nPoll based quizzes on the current or prior content.\nHomework. This is your testing ground, your first round of practice. Can you take what you learned and apply it to a data set.\nPeer reviews. Helping others enhances your own understanding.\nProject. Can you weave together data and story to do research? This is your second round of practice. Your work should be more polished than in your homework, and I will be grading them in more detail and using a rubric.\nFinal Exam. Can you analyze a new data set to answer a research question and write a professional report on your results?\n\nOkay, but what about the points?\n\nThe gradebook in Blackboard learn contains columns for all graded materials with point values.\nHomework assignments will be graded out of 10 points based on the quality of work and how much markup/corrections there are. You can think of a 9 as a 90%, 8 as an 80% etc. I rarely will go below a 5 unless you didn’t complete the assignment.\nProject based assignments have a rubric attached in Blackboard Learn that you can view.\nSee here for info on grading peer reviews.\nSee the syllabus for the percentage breakdown by assignment type and the percent to letter grade conversion.\n\n\n\nHow do I use Discord?\nHow to use Discord YouTube video channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppN9YbPX1Zo\n\nNOTE: You will be/have joined the Math & Stats server. You do not need to create one of your own.\n\n\n\nHow can I submit feedback?\nI want to make this class a welcome learning opportunity for everyone. I welcome your comments and constructive critique. What I do not welcome is flaming, trolling or insults. Here are some examples of appropriate uses of this feedback form.\n\nClass activities. What should I start doing, stop doing, and keep doing? Is the pace too fast? To slow?\nTopics: Is there something specific you would like brought up in class, but don’t want to be the one to bring it up?\nFlagging the Misfires. I am bound to make mistakes and microaggressions regarding culture, religion, gender, and diversity. Helping you feel safe is a real-time pursuit. If my remarks created discomfort, you can use this form to voice the concern quickly rather than saving it for the course evaluation months later.\nWords of Encouragement.

This is a good thing. They are looking from “untrained eyes”, which can be very critical to make sure you are explaining yourself clearly. I can better “figure out” what you are meaning to say - they are the ones that will best tell you when/where you need to explain your findings better.\nYou are expected to read your peer’s feedback and revise your work before it is graded.\n\n\n\nHow do I review my peers work?\n\nCheck the Peer Review Rotation spreadsheet to see who you are scheduled to review.\n\nIf one of your reviewees did not submit the assignment then pick another person to review.\n\nOpen their assignment file in Google Drive directly.\n\nIf this is a PDF, do not open as a google doc. Let it open in your browser window.\n\nBy using comment bubbles, provide feedback to your peers.\n\nBe specific. Give the type of feedback that you want to receive.\nMinimum three corrections or suggestions for improvement.\n\n❗ Use the “guide for peer reviews” included in each assignment. ⭐\n\n\n\nGiving good feedback\n\nCompliment the author. What did you like about their writing or plots?\nMake specific suggestions regarding things like word choices, use of details, organization, topic\nMark corrections such as spelling, grammar, punctuation, analysis methods, coding errors, but don’t try to turn their paper or style into your style.\nIf you find a claim that is not supported by data in the document (or cited) be sure to point it out.\nCheck their work against what is required. Do they have all required elements?\n\nOther resources (I’m always looking for more)\n\nhttps://blog.scholasticahq.com/post/how-to-write-helpful-peer-review-comments/\nLook at the questions posed in the bubbles for each section. https://violentmetaphors.com/2013/12/13/how-to-become-good-at-peer-review-a-guide-for-young-scientists/\nhttps://blog.cengage.com/top_blog/suggested-guidelines-for-student-peer-review/\n\n\n\nGrading of peer reviews\nAs I do my reviews on the same document, I will be reading and assessing your peer review.

While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine dependence that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decided that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. Below I have added to my codebook variables reflecting smoking levels (e.g. smoking quantity and frequency). If my topic is too vague, I would like to bring suicide in.

Here is a link to Purdue Owl APA style references that will guide you.\n\nNOTE: If you use a citation creator you still need to compare each part of all your references to make sure it was done correctly. The citation creator usually messes up on something.\nGood/suggested bibliography managers\n\nBibDesk (Mac) http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/\nZotero (in browser) https://www.zotero.org/\nMendeley (download) https://www.mendeley.com/\n\nUsing reference managers such as zotero and *.bib files with R Markdown\n\nTyler Clavelle reference tips\n[Rmarkdown template http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/02/svm-r-markdown-manuscript/\nRmarkdown cookbook\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\nRead an article, type up a brief summary (a few sentences) of what you learned about your topic from introduction/lit review and the discussion. This summary should convey the main themes and findings overall for the literature review and discussion in your own words.\n\n\nStep 3:\nThen explain how the article is going to help you with writing up your project. This is an explanation of what the article contributes to your project, not a restating of the summary. For example, is it going to help explain one or both of your topics, does it explain a key theory, what argument does it help you build for your project?\n\n\nExample\nMy research question is: Is self-efficacy associated with parent relations and academic performance?\nWeiser, D. A., & Riggio, H. R. (2010). Family background and academic achievement: Does self-efficacy mediate outcomes? Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal, 13(3), 367-383.\n\nThis article discusses whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between family background and academic achievement. This is very similar to my topic but I feel that the component of mediation changes it slightly. I found that family predictors did not correlate with academic achievement as much as self-efficacy correlates with parent’s expectation of academic success. Self-efficacy is linked to grade point average and academic success expectations.\nThis information will be vital to understanding the extent to which self-efficacy is related to academic performance. With the correlation being weak for family background and academic performance, it will do less to determine the connection of parental relations to self-efficacy.\n\nTurner, E. A., Chandler, M., & Heffer, R. W. (2009). The influence of parenting styles, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy on academic performance in college students. Journal of College Student Development, 50(3), 337-346.\n\nThis study looks at how parenting styles, authoritative in particular, relate to academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation in college students. It claims that all factors, academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, are all influenced by authoritative parenting. What I learned about my topic is this study did find that self-efficacy was not significantly linked to authoritative parenting.\nThis article will help explain how this specific type of parenting, authoritative, has little affect of self-efficacy. It does not however, claim that parenting, as a whole has not effect on self-efficacy. This study does confirm that parenting does reflect on academic performance.\n\nJunttila, N., Vauras, M., & Laakkonen, E. (2007). The role of parenting self-efficacy in children’s social and academic behavior. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 22(1), 41-61.\n\nThis article looks at parenting self-efficacy. This is a little different from my topic but there are aspects of it that will be useful. It tested Finnish mothers and fathers to test for loneliness, parent self-efficacy, their child’s peer evaluated social competence, self-evaluated loneliness and academic skills. It found that parents loneliness reflected in their self-efficacy. The relationship between parent self-efficacy and the child’s academic achievement were evaluated through the child’s social competence. What I learned from this article that I can use is that parent’s self-efficacy can be reflected in the children.\nThis article is gong to help me tie in influences in the parent relations with the children to determine self-efficacy. This is an interesting perspective that wasn’t originally in my research question but I believe it will give valuable insight."

    "text": "Throughout the entire semester you will be analyzing a data set with the end goal of creating a poster presentation to present your research. Your assignments will serve as a first draft of exploration into your research questions, and helps you build your story. Homework assignments alone will not be sufficient for a good analysis.\nYou will build up your project in stages, revising multiple times. The end goal is a research poster that you will present during finals week. You will be summarizing your findings using Google Slides. This will help you concisely explain your research topic and findings in a way will be easier to translate (fit) onto a poster. Here is the general outline, with each stage is explained in detail further below.\n\nStage 1: Choose a data set and identify a few research topics\nStage 2: Introduce your project and variables of interest\nStage 3: Explore your data and relationships\nStage 4: Analyze bivariate relationships\nStage 5: Multivariable modeling & summarizing findings\nStage 6: Poster Creation & Presentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer Review\n\n\n\nStages 2-6 are subject to peer review. See the help with peer review page for details.\nOnce you have addressed a particular piece of feedback mark it as “resolved” in Google Slides.\n⚠️ Do Not Delete Feedback until notified that it is okay\n\n\n\n\n\nAt each reviewed stage you should update anything you need to change based on feedback, such as correctly making graphics, writing results correctly etc.\nThere is a slide deck template and some example slides from prior students in Google Drive.\n\nThe template has more details about the contents of each slide and guidance for what should be included on that slide.\n\nThe contents of each slide are specified below.\n\nYou are welcome to have “staging” slides where you can dump content, thoughts, analyses that you may end up using. These extra slides should be at the END of the required slides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. D’s interpretation of your research\n\n\n\nI will be using this Google file to summarize your research progress as I do my reviews.

    "text": "Grading Method\nThis project overall is worth 30% of your grade. Instead of assigning specific points to each stage and adding up the points for an overall score, this work will be done through a series of revisions gaining feedback from both your peers and the instructor at each stage.\n\nInstead of a point number, for each item to be assessed (currently each slide) you will be marked as either “needing revision”, “meeting expectation”, or “exemplary”. .\n\nSee the Assessment Rubric here\nI will update your status column for the slides that are being assessed at that stage.\n\nI will also check on any prior slides that are at ‘needs revision’ stage.\n\nYou can request a reassessment of prior work at (nearly) any time. (You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I’m reviewing slides.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric under construction\n\n\n\nThis is a method of ‘ungrading’ that I have been wanting to try for a while. At the math congress (camping conference) I attended the first week of October a math educator discussed this method with us and so I was inspired to finally test it out. This project is a perfect opportunity to do so.\nThis means that the Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. Right now they are slightly modified from the old grading rubric. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for.\nEach person has their own ‘project assessment’ Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement stage you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it.\n\n\n\n… but points!??\nIn the end this still has to be converted to a point value/letter grade right? So here’s how I’m going to do it. The project makes up 110 points out of the total pts for the class.\n\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘exemplary’ and none at ‘needs revision’, that’s “A” work and you get the full 110 pts.\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 1 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “B” work and you get 95 pts. Note ‘meeting expectation’ does not correspond to A level work\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 80% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 2 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “C” work and you get 80 pts.\n\nThis is a graduate level class, so anything below a C is considered not passing. I don’t expect anyone to be at that stage by the end of the semester."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\nAdapted from Monica Linden at Brown University.\nFurthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries."
