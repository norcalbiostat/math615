Here is how I check in on your progress throughout the semester\n\nPoll based quizzes on the current or prior content. (Completion only, not correctness)\nHomework. This is your testing ground, your first round of practice. Can you take what you learned and apply it to a data set.\nPeer reviews. Helping others enhances your own understanding.\nProject. Can you weave together data and story to do research?\nFinal Exam. Can you analyze a new data set to answer a research question and write a professional report on your results?\n\nOkay, but what about the points?\n\nHomework assignments will be graded on a rubric in BBL. It‚Äôs advised you check your work against this rubric before you submit the final version.\nSee here for info on grading peer reviews.\nSee the syllabus for the percentage breakdown by assignment type and the percent to letter grade conversion.\n\n\n\nHow do I use Discord?\nHow to use Discord YouTube video channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppN9YbPX1Zo\n\nNOTE: You will be/have joined the Math & Stats server. You do not need to create one of your own.\n\n\n\nHow can I submit feedback?\nI want to make this class a welcome learning opportunity for everyone. I welcome your comments and constructive critique. What I do not welcome is flaming, trolling or insults. Here are some examples of appropriate uses of this feedback form.\n\nClass activities. What should I start doing, stop doing, and keep doing? Is the pace too fast? To slow?\nTopics: Is there something specific you would like brought up in class, but don‚Äôt want to be the one to bring it up?\nFlagging the Misfires. I am bound to make mistakes and microaggressions regarding culture, religion, gender, and diversity. Helping you feel safe is a real-time pursuit. If my remarks created discomfort, you can use this form to voice the concern quickly rather than saving it for the course evaluation months later.\nWords of Encouragement.

This is a good thing. They are looking from ‚Äúuntrained eyes‚Äù, which can be very critical to make sure you are explaining yourself clearly.

I help to manage their research and evaluation team.\nI have yet another hat as a PI for Project DA-FANH, a multi-campus collaboration whose goal is to retain and graduate highly qualified students while dismantling barriers and existing stereotypes. We aim to build a pathway for students of color in the intersection of Data Science/Data Analytics within food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences (FANH) careers. We run workshops and internships for both graduate and undergraduate students.\nWhen I‚Äôm not on campus, typically I‚Äôm growing food for my family, out adventuring with my dogs, or getting some game time in.\nYou can learn more about the work that I do on my website"

You can use one language in here and another language for another class or project.\nYour professors in your other classes, or your masters committee may want you to learn a specific language. That should influence your choice.\n\nSo should your industry. Don‚Äôt make assumptions, look at job postings and see what they want.\nI.e.

When not presenting, you will be scoring the other half of the class‚Äôs posters.\n\nPosters can be in powerpoint (the standard format for research posters), or Google Slides (once appropriately sized)\n\nRegardless of the file type, you must use a template. Do not try to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n\nPoster Guidelines\nhttps://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/poster_guidelines/\n\nLinks to poster templates,\nDetails on what each section should contain\nGuidance on aesthetics and printing (when appropriate)\nEvaluation criteria\nExamples of professional and prior student work.\n\n\n\nDraft version\n\nThis draft is graded on how complete the poster is. You should consider this a draft that you would circulate to your colleagues for final review and comments.\nUse the evaluation criteria as a guide for what I am looking for.\nThis assignment is graded in Blackboard using a rubric - be sure to look at this before you submit.\n\nPoints are awarded based off how close to presentation quality your poster is by the time the draft is due.\nBasically the more work I think you need to put into your poster to make it presentable, the lower the points you get for the draft.\n\n\nSubmission and Peer Review Instructions\n\nSave your poster as a PDF and upload to the Google Drive/Project Poster Drafts folder.\nTo conduct your peer review, open the PDF from Google Drive directly in your browser.\n\nUse the comment feature to write the comments directly into the poster file itself.\nprovide at least two specific comments for each\n\nsomething that can be improved\nsomething that is good\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Version\n\nUpload your final poster (as printed) to the Google Drive/Project Poster Final Version folder.\n\nPDF preferred. PPTX ok.\n\nScoring will be done via Google Forms. It looks exactly like the evaluation criteria.\n\nWhen not presenting, you will walk around and learn about others research. Ask them questions, fill out the evaluation on your phone as you go. Printed copies will be available upon request so you can submit later.\n\nThe final grade will be determined by\n\nBase score = 30% student score + 70% instructor score + bonus pts for best in show awards - 1 point penalty for each day late."

No graphs needed\n\n\nSlide 15: Testing for confounding relationships\n\nConfounding:\n\nIf you found a confounder: on slide with bivariate relationship that was confounded put a bullet point that explains what variable confounded the relationship and put the written results that are shown in the confounding assignment on how to write results. Make sure to explain if it helped improve prediction of response variable.\nIf you did NOT find a confounder: Include a slide stating what relationships you tested for confounds and with what variable to see if it was a confound, explaining that it was not a moderator.
