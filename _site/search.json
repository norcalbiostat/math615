I am not sure which variables I will use regarding nicotine dependence (e.g. symptoms or diagnosis) so for now I will include all of the relevant variables in my personal codebook. While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine dependence that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decided that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. Below I have added to my codebook variables reflecting smoking levels (e.g. smoking quantity and frequency). If my topic is too vague, I would like to bring suicide in. I would be interested to see if there is any relationship between level of smoking with nicotine dependence and suicide."

Before you start this assignment be sure to have read the article on “how to read a journal article”, and the lecture notes on “how to conduct a literature review”. This assignment will help you identify gaps in the current literature regarding your research topic, and refine your research question and set of potential variables substantially.\nYou need at least 3 primary source references that are directly related to your topic that were published in 2008 or more recent.\nFor each article, you will complete steps 1-3, in other words 3 times. There is an example at the bottom of this document.\n\nStep 1:\n\nPut the reference for the article in APA style. Here is a link to Purdue Owl APA style references that will guide you.\n\nNOTE: If you use a citation creator you still need to compare each part of all your references to make sure it was done correctly. The citation creator usually messes up on something.\nGood/suggested bibliography managers\n\nBibDesk (Mac) http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/\nZotero (in browser) https://www.zotero.org/\nMendeley (download) https://www.mendeley.com/\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\nRead an article, type up a brief summary (a few sentences) of what you learned about your topic from introduction/lit review and the discussion. This summary should convey the main themes and findings overall for the literature review and discussion in your own words.\n\n\nStep 3:\nThen explain how the article is going to help you with writing up your project. This is an explanation of what the article contributes to your project, not a restating of the summary. For example, is it going to help explain one or both of your topics, does it explain a key theory, what argument does it help you build for your project?\n\nLit review examples\n\nMy research question is: Is self-efficacy associated with parent relations and academic performance?\nWeiser, D. A., & Riggio, H. R. (2010). Family background and academic achievement: Does self-efficacy mediate outcomes? Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal, 13(3), 367-383.\n\nThis article discusses whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between family background and academic achievement. This is very similar to my topic but I feel that the component of mediation changes it slightly. I found that family predictors did not correlate with academic achievement as much as self-efficacy correlates with parent’s expectation of academic success. Self-efficacy is linked to grade point average and academic success expectations.\nThis information will be vital to understanding the extent to which self-efficacy is related to academic performance. With the correlation being weak for family background and academic performance, it will do less to determine the connection of parental relations to self-efficacy.\n\nTurner, E. A., Chandler, M., & Heffer, R. W. (2009). The influence of parenting styles, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy on academic performance in college students. Journal of College Student Development, 50(3), 337-346.\n\nThis study looks at how parenting styles, authoritative in particular, relate to academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation in college students. It claims that all factors, academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, are all influenced by authoritative parenting. What I learned about my topic is this study did find that self-efficacy was not significantly linked to authoritative parenting.\nThis article will help explain how this specific type of parenting, authoritative, has little affect of self-efficacy. It does not however, claim that parenting, as a whole has not effect on self-efficacy. This study does confirm that parenting does reflect on academic performance.\n\nJunttila, N., Vauras, M., & Laakkonen, E. (2007). The role of parenting self-efficacy in children’s social and academic behavior. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 22(1), 41-61.\n\nThis article looks at parenting self-efficacy. This is a little different from my topic but there are aspects of it that will be useful. It tested Finnish mothers and fathers to test for loneliness, parent self-efficacy, their child’s peer evaluated social competence, self-evaluated loneliness and academic skills. It found that parents loneliness reflected in their self-efficacy. The relationship between parent self-efficacy and the child’s academic achievement were evaluated through the child’s social competence. What I learned from this article that I can use is that parent’s self-efficacy can be reflected in the children.\nThis article is gong to help me tie in influences in the parent relations with the children to determine self-efficacy. This is an interesting perspective that wasn’t originally in my research question but I believe it will give valuable insight."

Sagebrush ecosystem degradation has mostly been attributed to human disturbances, invasive plants, and woody plant encroachment. These hydrological impacts in sagebrush ecosystems are attributed to the change in vegetation structure and alterations in the ecosystem’s fire regime. Soil hydrophobicity is one hydrologic characteristic that is influenced by these changes. This analysis seeks to clarify the effect of tree-removal treatments and fire on soil hydrophobicity in a woodland-encroached sagebrush ecosystem.\n\nAbstract written by Dr.D. by copying selected lines from the intro.\n\nRead their paper here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis study aims to assess how regenerative agriculture affects PLFA biomass and fungal-to-bacteria ratios in soil systems by depth yearly. There is an increased demand for food systems and overwhelming evidence that our current agricultural practices have devastating environmental effects. Results demonstrate that RA significantly enhances microbial biomass compared to conventional methods, with consistently higher biomass across all years. However, both systems experienced declines in biomass in 2023, with RA showing partial recovery in 2024 while conventional systems stagnated. Depth-specific analyses revealed significant increases in F:B ratios at deeper soil layers, though overall trends in F:B ratios fluctuated, with an increase in 2023 followed by a decline in 2024. These patterns suggest that while RA supports soil microbial health, broader environmental or systemic pressures, such as climate variability or soil management practices, may also influence microbial dynamics.\nThese findings align with existing literature highlighting the benefits of RA for soil health and microbial diversity, yet underscore the complexity of soil ecosystems and the need for further research. The work supports the hypothesis that RA enhances microbial biomass over time and offers valuable insights for sustainable agricultural policy and practice while emphasizing the necessity of long-term studies to capture its potential benefits fully.\nRead their paper here"

I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist.

Common reasons to join the class virtually: - you’re sick - you’re out of town\nDon’t expect as good of quality of presentation, and this is not a long term solution/resource. Don’t abuse this resource."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nStudents are expected to be familiar with the University’s Policy on Student Academic Integrityhttps://www.csuchico.edu/pres/_assets/documents/em-25-015.pdf. Specific sections of this policy are highlighted below as they pertain to this class. Refer to the linked document for definitions.\nAs an instructor I recognize there are a variety of AI programs available to assist in creating text and writing code. However, I want to stress that, AI programs are not a replacement for human creativity, originality, and critical thinking. Writing (text and code) is a skill that you must nurture over time in order to develop your own individual voice, style, and view.\nThe use of chat GPT is allowed/encouraged to help you learn how to code but all code used must be fully explained in text. We will cover what this means and how to do this when we start data management around week 3. How ChatGPT can help you write code\nYou are responsible for fact checking the accuracy of statements composed by AI language models. These models are known to produce bullshit responses. And yes, this is a technical term.\n\nAI and ChatGPT Usage: AI writing or coding tools are not permitted for any stage or phase of work in this class. Using AI to help debug, or suggest coding approaches is a useful tool for any coder - but only once you have a solid foundation.\nCollaboration: You are highly encouraged to work together with a classmate to learn the materials in this class. However your work must be 100% a product of your personal effort. Coding styles are similar to writing styles, each person will have their own unique voice and style.\nPlagiarism and Self-Plagiarism: Plagiarism from the course notes and from your prior work are highly encouraged. Don’t try to start from scratch each time. If you’ve done something before and need it again - find it and copy/paste/adjust. The biggest benefit to programming in a language such as R is to automate repetitive tasks, and ensure your work is reproducible. Self-plagiarism is a hallmark of a good programmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe up front!\n\n\n\nWhen presenting text written by Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, you must include an appropriate citation. https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt\nThis also goes for when you have it write code for you. You need to indicate when and where you used it.\n\n\n\nNot allowed\n\nWorking with or getting help from others on exams and individual quizzes\nCopying code from another student’s homework and presenting it as your own work.\nCopy/paste from AI tools or internet sources without customization, citation or explanation\nGetting your sibling/friend/colleague to write code for you\nSubmitting any assignment that is not your own personal effort.\n\n\n\nAllowed\n\nHelping each other solve homework problems (concepts or code)\nUse AI to help explain a concept\nUse AI to generate starter code that you modify for your own example.\nUse AI to write code that you cite/disclose and you explain in your words what it is doing in details.\nCopy/paste code from my course notes (this is actually encouraged!)\n\n\nIf at any time I suspect that the work you are submitting is not reflective of your personal knowledge I may ask you to verbally explain a piece of code to me. If your explanation is insufficient may result in a 0 on that assignment.\nAny use outside of this permission constitutes a violation of Chico State’s Integrity Policy and may result in you being reported to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities.\nYour own commitment to learning, as evidenced by your enrollment at California State University, Chico, and the University’s Academic Integrity Policy requires you to be honest in all your academic course work. If you act against these policies your actions will be considered academically dishonest, and a violation of Chico State’s Integrity Policy and you may be reported to the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities.Faculty members are required to report all infractions to the Office of Student Judicial Affairs."
