Here is how I check in on your progress throughout the semester\n\nPoll based quizzes on the current or prior content. (Completion only, not correctness)\nHomework. This is your testing ground, your first round of practice. Can you take what you learned and apply it to a data set.\nPeer reviews. Helping others enhances your own understanding.\nProject. Can you weave together data and story to do research?\nFinal Exam. Can you analyze a new data set to answer a research question and write a professional report on your results?\n\nOkay, but what about the points?\n\nHomework assignments will be graded on a rubric in BBL. It‚Äôs advised you check your work against this rubric before you submit the final version.\nSee here for info on grading peer reviews.\nSee the syllabus for the percentage breakdown by assignment type and the percent to letter grade conversion.\n\n\n\nHow do I use Discord?\nHow to use Discord YouTube video channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppN9YbPX1Zo\n\nNOTE: You will be/have joined the Math & Stats server. You do not need to create one of your own.\n\n\n\nHow can I submit feedback?\nI want to make this class a welcome learning opportunity for everyone. I welcome your comments and constructive critique. What I do not welcome is flaming, trolling or insults. Here are some examples of appropriate uses of this feedback form.\n\nClass activities. What should I start doing, stop doing, and keep doing? Is the pace too fast? To slow?\nTopics: Is there something specific you would like brought up in class, but don‚Äôt want to be the one to bring it up?\nFlagging the Misfires. I am bound to make mistakes and microaggressions regarding culture, religion, gender, and diversity. Helping you feel safe is a real-time pursuit. If my remarks created discomfort, you can use this form to voice the concern quickly rather than saving it for the course evaluation months later.\nWords of Encouragement.

This is a good thing. They are looking from ‚Äúuntrained eyes‚Äù, which can be very critical to make sure you are explaining yourself clearly. I can better ‚Äúfigure out‚Äù what you are meaning to say - they are the ones that will best tell you when/where you need to explain your findings better.\n\n\n\nHow do I conduct a Peer Review\n\nCheck the Peer Review Rotation spreadsheet to see who you are scheduled to review.\n\nIf one of your reviewees did not submit the assignment then pick another person to review.\n\nOpen the assignment file in Google Drive directly.\nChange from ‚Äúediting‚Äù to ‚Äúsuggesting‚Äù in the top right.\nBy editing the verbiage directly, or using comment bubbles, provide feedback to your peers.\n\nBe specific. Give the type of feedback that you want to receive.\nMinimum three corrections or suggestions for improvement. If it is reworking/grammar make these edits directly in the document.\n\n\n\n\nGrading of peer reviews\nAs I do my reviews on the same document, I will be reading and assessing your peer review. If I find your review is not providing quality feedback to the author you will not receive credit for that review. You may see the cells in the peer review spreadsheet changing color as I check off your review."

For example lecture notes and the sylalbus go in the documents folder, homework code files in the scripts folder, data and codebook in, you guessed it, the data folder, and code specifically for your project in the project folder.\nThis means when you download a file, right click and ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù or ‚ÄúSave target as‚Äù and actively choose where to download this file.

You can‚Äôt learn all the things in 2 years.\n\nThere is an entire secton on the help page of the class website that is devoted to programming resources.\n\nAll my lecture notes use R. This entire website is built with R. R is a pioneer in generating reproducible and publishable quality reports.\n\nHere‚Äôs an student-generated example\n\nI will not dictate which software program you use in this class. Homework 0 has more information on the two historically popular programs for this class; SPSS and R.\nBut I will expect you to submit reproducible code. You can point and click your way to an answer, but code must be saved and reusable with minimal changes.\nBe open to new things, there is power in being polyglottal. You can use one language in here and another language for another class or project.\nYour professors in your other classes, or your masters committee may want you to learn a specific language. That should influence your choice.\n\nSo should your industry. Don‚Äôt make assumptions, look at job postings and see what they want.\nI.e. Center for Healthy Communities has a lot of Nutrition faculty/students. They‚Äôre solidly using R.\nPolitical Science & Economics often use Stata. I‚Äôve met Sociologists that use SAS, Stata, R and SPSS.\n\nI am fluent in SAS, STATA and R, reasonably read in SPSS but can provide limited support for Python.\nThe choice of software you use for this class is up to you, but you will be expected to learn how to navigate the programs outside of class time.\nI highly recommend making a habit to attend Community Coding even if it‚Äôs just to sit and do your work with your peers.\n\n\n\nüîó https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615 / Hello Math 615 Fall 22 cohort"
