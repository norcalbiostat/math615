I am not sure which variables I will use regarding nicotine dependence (e.g. symptoms or diagnosis) so for now I will include all of the relevant variables in my personal codebook. While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine dependence that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decided that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. Below I have added to my codebook variables reflecting smoking levels (e.g. smoking quantity and frequency). If my topic is too vague, I would like to bring suicide in. I would be interested to see if there is any relationship between level of smoking with nicotine dependence and suicide."

This summary should convey the main themes and findings overall for the literature review and discussion in your own words.\n\n\nStep 3:\nThen explain how the article is going to help you with writing up your project. This is an explanation of what the article contributes to your project, not a restating of the summary. For example, is it going to help explain one or both of your topics, does it explain a key theory, what argument does it help you build for your project?\n\nLit review examples\n\nMy research question is: Is self-efficacy associated with parent relations and academic performance?\nWeiser, D. A., & Riggio, H. R. (2010). Family background and academic achievement: Does self-efficacy mediate outcomes? Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal, 13(3), 367-383.\n\nThis article discusses whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between family background and academic achievement. This is very similar to my topic but I feel that the component of mediation changes it slightly. I found that family predictors did not correlate with academic achievement as much as self-efficacy correlates with parent’s expectation of academic success. Self-efficacy is linked to grade point average and academic success expectations.\nThis information will be vital to understanding the extent to which self-efficacy is related to academic performance. With the correlation being weak for family background and academic performance, it will do less to determine the connection of parental relations to self-efficacy.\n\nTurner, E. A., Chandler, M., & Heffer, R. W. (2009). The influence of parenting styles, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy on academic performance in college students. Journal of College Student Development, 50(3), 337-346.\n\nThis study looks at how parenting styles, authoritative in particular, relate to academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation in college students. It claims that all factors, academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, are all influenced by authoritative parenting. What I learned about my topic is this study did find that self-efficacy was not significantly linked to authoritative parenting.\nThis article will help explain how this specific type of parenting, authoritative, has little affect of self-efficacy. It does not however, claim that parenting, as a whole has not effect on self-efficacy. This study does confirm that parenting does reflect on academic performance.\n\nJunttila, N., Vauras, M., & Laakkonen, E. (2007). The role of parenting self-efficacy in children’s social and academic behavior. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 22(1), 41-61.\n\nThis article looks at parenting self-efficacy. This is a little different from my topic but there are aspects of it that will be useful. It tested Finnish mothers and fathers to test for loneliness, parent self-efficacy, their child’s peer evaluated social competence, self-evaluated loneliness and academic skills. It found that parents loneliness reflected in their self-efficacy. The relationship between parent self-efficacy and the child’s academic achievement were evaluated through the child’s social competence. What I learned from this article that I can use is that parent’s self-efficacy can be reflected in the children.\nThis article is gong to help me tie in influences in the parent relations with the children to determine self-efficacy. This is an interesting perspective that wasn’t originally in my research question but I believe it will give valuable insight."

This is indicative of a nonlinear trend somewhere in the data.\nThe variance of Y is not constant. This is a warning that our linear model does not fit the data well and we should look into possible refinements and improvements.\nThe observed distribution of bill length is bimodal, and so the model is overestimating some values and underestimating others. There is clearly some other confounding variable that predicts bill length better than just body mass.\n\n\n\n6.

R2: 0.352\n\n\n\nFor a penguin who weighs 0 kg, the predicted bill length is 26.9 (24.4, 29.4)mm. This is an impossible situation.\n\nEach 1g increase in body mass of a penguin is associated with a significant increase of 0.004 (0.0035, 0.0046) mm of bill length (p&lt;.0001). In more reasonable numbers, an increase of 1kg of body mass in a penguin corresponds to a 4(3.5, 4.6) mm increase in bill length.\nBody mass explains 35.4% of the variation in bill length.\n\nHowever, model diagnostics indicate that a linear model may not be appropriate for this relationship. The assumption of constant variance is not upheld and there may be another variable that affects bill length."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe sagebrush ecosystem is one of the most at-risk ecosystems in the United States. Sagebrush ecosystem degradation has mostly been attributed to human disturbances, invasive plants, and woody plant encroachment. These hydrological impacts in sagebrush ecosystems are attributed to the change in vegetation structure and alterations in the ecosystem’s fire regime. Soil hydrophobicity is one hydrologic characteristic that is influenced by these changes. This analysis seeks to clarify the effect of tree-removal treatments and fire on soil hydrophobicity in a woodland-encroached sagebrush ecosystem.\n\nAbstract written by Dr.D. by copying selected lines from the intro.\n\nRead their paper here"

Data were sourced from an AmeriFlux tower, capturing a variety of weather variables. After aggregating the observations to monthly means, and shifting RECO back 2 months temporally, we found a linear relationship between RECO and soil water content with a bivariate model, and a statistically significant relationship between RECO and a combination of SWC and temperature.\nRead their paper here"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis study aims to assess how regenerative agriculture affects PLFA biomass and fungal-to-bacteria ratios in soil systems by depth yearly. There is an increased demand for food systems and overwhelming evidence that our current agricultural practices have devastating environmental effects. Results demonstrate that RA significantly enhances microbial biomass compared to conventional methods, with consistently higher biomass across all years. However, both systems experienced declines in biomass in 2023, with RA showing partial recovery in 2024 while conventional systems stagnated. Depth-specific analyses revealed significant increases in F:B ratios at deeper soil layers, though overall trends in F:B ratios fluctuated, with an increase in 2023 followed by a decline in 2024. These patterns suggest that while RA supports soil microbial health, broader environmental or systemic pressures, such as climate variability or soil management practices, may also influence microbial dynamics.\nThese findings align with existing literature highlighting the benefits of RA for soil health and microbial diversity, yet underscore the complexity of soil ecosystems and the need for further research. The work supports the hypothesis that RA enhances microbial biomass over time and offers valuable insights for sustainable agricultural policy and practice while emphasizing the necessity of long-term studies to capture its potential benefits fully.\nRead their paper here"

(ASCN 19.7)\n\nShut down R studio fully, navigate to your class folder, and open your project file (the cube) before you continue.\n\nRead through and follow the “Hello Quarto” tutorial (19.8 intro)\nInstall the tinytex program so you can create PDFs from your Quarto document. This is required (19.8)\n\nIf you have difficulty with any of this, visit Community Coding, my office hours, or post in Discord."
