While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine dependence that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decided that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. Below I have added to my codebook variables reflecting smoking levels (e.g.¬†smoking quantity and frequency). If my topic is too vague, I would like to bring suicide in.

This assignment will help you identify gaps in the current literature regarding your research topic, and refine your research question and set of potential variables substantially.\nYou need at least 3 primary source references that are directly related to your topic that were published in 2008 or more recent.\nFor each article, you will complete steps 1-3, in other words 3 times. There is an example at the bottom of this document.\n\nStep 1:\n\nPut the reference for the article in APA style.

This summary should convey the main themes and findings overall for the literature review and discussion in your own words.\n\n\nStep 3:\nThen explain how the article is going to help you with writing up your project. This is an explanation of what the article contributes to your project, not a restating of the summary. For example, is it going to help explain one or both of your topics, does it explain a key theory, what argument does it help you build for your project?\n\n\nExample\nMy research question is: Is self-efficacy associated with parent relations and academic performance?\nWeiser, D. A., & Riggio, H. R. (2010). Family background and academic achievement: Does self-efficacy mediate outcomes? Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal, 13(3), 367-383.\n\nThis article discusses whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between family background and academic achievement. This is very similar to my topic but I feel that the component of mediation changes it slightly. I found that family predictors did not correlate with academic achievement as much as self-efficacy correlates with parent‚Äôs expectation of academic success. Self-efficacy is linked to grade point average and academic success expectations.\nThis information will be vital to understanding the extent to which self-efficacy is related to academic performance. With the correlation being weak for family background and academic performance, it will do less to determine the connection of parental relations to self-efficacy.\n\nTurner, E. A., Chandler, M., & Heffer, R. W. (2009). The influence of parenting styles, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy on academic performance in college students. Journal of College Student Development, 50(3), 337-346.\n\nThis study looks at how parenting styles, authoritative in particular, relate to academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation in college students. It claims that all factors, academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, are all influenced by authoritative parenting. What I learned about my topic is this study did find that self-efficacy was not significantly linked to authoritative parenting.\nThis article will help explain how this specific type of parenting, authoritative, has little affect of self-efficacy. It does not however, claim that parenting, as a whole has not effect on self-efficacy. This study does confirm that parenting does reflect on academic performance.\n\nJunttila, N., Vauras, M., & Laakkonen, E. (2007). The role of parenting self-efficacy in children‚Äôs social and academic behavior. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 22(1), 41-61.\n\nThis article looks at parenting self-efficacy. This is a little different from my topic but there are aspects of it that will be useful. It tested Finnish mothers and fathers to test for loneliness, parent self-efficacy, their child‚Äôs peer evaluated social competence, self-evaluated loneliness and academic skills. It found that parents loneliness reflected in their self-efficacy. The relationship between parent self-efficacy and the child‚Äôs academic achievement were evaluated through the child‚Äôs social competence. What I learned from this article that I can use is that parent‚Äôs self-efficacy can be reflected in the children.\nThis article is gong to help me tie in influences in the parent relations with the children to determine self-efficacy. This is an interesting perspective that wasn‚Äôt originally in my research question but I believe it will give valuable insight."

Here is the general outline, with each stage is explained in detail further below.\n\nStage 1: Choose a data set and identify a few research topics\nStage 2: Introduce your project and variables of interest\nStage 3: Explore your data and relationships\nStage 4: Analyze bivariate relationships\nStage 5: Multivariable modeling & summarizing findings\nStage 6: Poster Creation & Presentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer Review\n\n\n\nStages 2-6 are subject to peer review. See the help with peer review page for details.\n\n\n\nAt each reviewed stage you should update anything you need to change, such as correctly making graphics, writing results correctly etc.\nThere is an example slide deck in Google Drive named AAA Example/Template. This has more details about the contents of each slide and guidance for what should be included on that slide.\nThere is a grading rubric in Blackboard that you can self-check your submission against prior to grading.\nThis includes reviewing the current set of feedback and making the appropriate corrections.\n\nOnce you have addressed a particular piece of feedback mark it as ‚Äúresolved‚Äù in Google Slides.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Delete Feedback.\n\nYour presentation should be limited to approximately 20 slides. The contents of each slide are specified below.\n\nYou are welcome to have ‚Äústaging‚Äù slides where you can dump content, thoughts, analyses that you may end up using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr.¬†D‚Äôs interpretation of your research\n\n\n\nI will be using this Google file to summarize your research progress as I do my reviews. I may ask you to review it and address critical questions."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\nAdapted from Monica Linden at Brown University.\nFurthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries."
