While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine dependence that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decided that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. Below I have added to my codebook variables reflecting smoking levels (e.g. smoking quantity and frequency). If my topic is too vague, I would like to bring suicide in. I would be interested to see if there is any relationship between level of smoking with nicotine dependence and suicide."

Before you start this assignment be sure to have read the article on “how to read a journal article”, and the lecture notes on “how to conduct a literature review”. This assignment will help you identify gaps in the current literature regarding your research topic, and refine your research question and set of potential variables substantially.\nYou need at least 3 primary source references that are directly related to your topic that were published in 2008 or more recent.\nFor each article, you will complete steps 1-3, in other words 3 times. There is an example at the bottom of this document.\n\nStep 1:\n\nPut the reference for the article in APA style. Here is a link to Purdue Owl APA style references that will guide you.\n\nNOTE: If you use a citation creator you still need to compare each part of all your references to make sure it was done correctly. The citation creator usually messes up on something.\nGood/suggested bibliography managers\n\nBibDesk (Mac) http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/\nZotero (in browser) https://www.zotero.org/\nMendeley (download) https://www.mendeley.com/\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\nRead an article, type up a brief summary (a few sentences) of what you learned about your topic from introduction/lit review and the discussion. This summary should convey the main themes and findings overall for the literature review and discussion in your own words.\n\n\nStep 3:\nThen explain how the article is going to help you with writing up your project. This is an explanation of what the article contributes to your project, not a restating of the summary. For example, is it going to help explain one or both of your topics, does it explain a key theory, what argument does it help you build for your project?\n\nLit review examples\n\nMy research question is: Is self-efficacy associated with parent relations and academic performance?\nWeiser, D. A., & Riggio, H. R. (2010). Family background and academic achievement: Does self-efficacy mediate outcomes? Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal, 13(3), 367-383.\n\nThis article discusses whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between family background and academic achievement. This is very similar to my topic but I feel that the component of mediation changes it slightly. I found that family predictors did not correlate with academic achievement as much as self-efficacy correlates with parent’s expectation of academic success. Self-efficacy is linked to grade point average and academic success expectations.\nThis information will be vital to understanding the extent to which self-efficacy is related to academic performance. With the correlation being weak for family background and academic performance, it will do less to determine the connection of parental relations to self-efficacy.\n\nTurner, E. A., Chandler, M., & Heffer, R. W. (2009). The influence of parenting styles, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy on academic performance in college students. Journal of College Student Development, 50(3), 337-346.\n\nThis study looks at how parenting styles, authoritative in particular, relate to academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation in college students. It claims that all factors, academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, are all influenced by authoritative parenting. What I learned about my topic is this study did find that self-efficacy was not significantly linked to authoritative parenting.\nThis article will help explain how this specific type of parenting, authoritative, has little affect of self-efficacy. It does not however, claim that parenting, as a whole has not effect on self-efficacy. This study does confirm that parenting does reflect on academic performance.\n\nJunttila, N., Vauras, M., & Laakkonen, E. (2007). The role of parenting self-efficacy in children’s social and academic behavior. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 22(1), 41-61.\n\nThis article looks at parenting self-efficacy. This is a little different from my topic but there are aspects of it that will be useful. It tested Finnish mothers and fathers to test for loneliness, parent self-efficacy, their child’s peer evaluated social competence, self-evaluated loneliness and academic skills. It found that parents loneliness reflected in their self-efficacy. The relationship between parent self-efficacy and the child’s academic achievement were evaluated through the child’s social competence. What I learned from this article that I can use is that parent’s self-efficacy can be reflected in the children.\nThis article is gong to help me tie in influences in the parent relations with the children to determine self-efficacy. This is an interesting perspective that wasn’t originally in my research question but I believe it will give valuable insight."

Now is the time to refine this question. Here are some example revisions.\n\nQuestions example:\na) Does the number of cigarettes smoked in the past month relate to nicotine dependence in college-aged adults in the United States?\nb) Is there a relationship between smoking frequency and suicide? Is this relationship the same in males and females?"

This assignment uses your chosen research data, and the variables that you chose in the last assignment when you created a personal research codebook. You will thoughtfully review the variables you are interested in, document which ones will need changed and how.\nAll raw data needs to stay raw, and all changes need to be documented. You will create a script/code file that will make all changes to the data in a programatically and reproducible way. You will create a single code file that imports your raw data, performs some data cleaning steps, and saves out an analysis ready data set that you will use throughout the semester.\nYou are not expected to have completed data management for every one of your variables under consideration by the submission date. I want to see a VERY good effort has been made (raw data read in, at least 2 quant and 2 cat variables dealt with, analysis data saved out.)\nCheck the rubric in Canvas for more grade specific details."

You should consider this a draft that you would circulate to your colleagues for final review and comments.\n\nBasically the more work I think you need to put into your poster to make it presentable, the lower the points you get for the draft.\n\nUse the evaluation criteria as a guide for what I am looking for.\n\nSubmission and Peer Review Instructions\n\nSave your poster as a PDF and upload to the Google Drive/Project Poster Drafts folder.\nTo conduct your peer review, open the PDF from Google Drive directly in your browser.\n\nUse the comment feature to write the comments directly into the poster file itself.\nprovide at least two specific comments for each\n\nsomething that can be improved\nsomething that is good\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Version\n\nUpload your final poster (as printed) to the Google Drive/Project Poster Final Version folder.\n\nPDF preferred. PPTX ok.\n\nScoring will be done via Google Forms. It looks exactly like the evaluation criteria.\n\nWhen not presenting, you will walk around and learn about others research. Ask them questions, fill out the evaluation on your phone as you go. Printed copies will be available upon request so you can submit later.\n\nThe final grade will be determined by\n\nBase score = 30% student score + 70% instructor score + bonus pts for best in show awards."

    "text": "Grading Method\nInstead of assigning specific points to each stage and adding up the points for an overall score, this work will be done through a series of revisions gaining feedback from both your peers and the instructor at each stage.\n\nFor each slide to be assessed you will be marked as either “needing revision”, “meeting expectation”, or “exemplary”.\nI will update your status column for the slides that are being assessed at that stage.\n\nI will also check on any prior slides that are at ‘needs revision’ stage.\n\nYou can request a reassessment of prior work at (nearly) any time. (You can ask for it, I just may not get to it until the next time I’m reviewing slides.)\nYou are responsible for keeping track of your status! Suggestion - use conditional formatting on column F in your sheet. This is the color scheme I use:\n\nGo to “Format –&gt; Conditional Formatting”\nSingle color, apply to range F2:F22\nFormat cells if\n\nText contains Not Assessible (Red)\nText contains ME (light green)\nText is exactly E (dark green)\nText contains NR (yellow)\n\n\n\n\nRubric\nThis is a method of ‘ungrading’ that I have been wanting to try for a while. At the math congress (camping conference) I attended the first week of October a math educator discussed this method with us and so I was inspired to finally test it out. This project is a perfect opportunity to do so.\nThis means that the Assessment item descriptions are a work in progress. Right now they are slightly modified from the old grading rubric. I may add, combine, or reword items as I do my revisions to better fit what I am actually looking for.\nEach person has their own ‘project assessment’ Google spreadsheet (same location as your poster) that shows you what achievement stage you are at for each item. It is locked to only view mode and only you and I have access to it.\n\n\n… but points!??\nIn the end this still has to be converted to a point value/letter grade right? So here’s how I’m going to do it. The poster prep slides make up 80 out of the 110 points for the project.\n\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘exemplary’ and none at ‘needs revision’, that’s “A” work and you get the full 80 pts.\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 90% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 1 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “B” work and you get 72 pts. Note ‘meeting expectation’ does not correspond to A level work\nIf you have \\(\\geq\\) 80% of assessment items at ‘meets expectation’ and no more than 2 at ‘needs revision’, that’s “C” work and you get 64 pts.\n\nThis is a graduate level class, so anything below a C is considered not passing. I don’t expect anyone to be at that stage by the end of the semester."

    "text": "Sure, here’s an example of how you can change the factor order of the island variable in the Palmer Penguins dataset to put “Dream” first using R:\n# Load necessary packages\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata(\"penguins\")\n\n# Check the current levels of the 'island' factor\nlevels(penguins$island)\n\n# Reorder the levels of the 'island' factor to put \"Dream\" first\npenguins$island &lt;- factor(penguins$island, levels = c(\"Dream\", \"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\"))\n\n# Check the new order of levels\nlevels(penguins$island)\nIn this code, we’re first loading the palmerpenguins package, which provides access to the dataset. Then we load the dataset itself using data(\"penguins\"). We check the current levels of the island factor using levels(penguins$island).\nNext, we use the factor() function to reorder the levels of the island variable. We specify the desired order of levels using the levels argument. In this case, we put “Dream” first, followed by the other islands. Finally, we check the new order of levels to make sure the change was successful.\nMake sure you have the palmerpenguins package installed. You can install it using install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\") if you haven’t done so already."

There are a few more steps to take that will allow you to be best setup for using R to analyze data.\nFollow the instructions in the Appendix of the Applied Stats Course Notes to do the following:\n\nSet preferences for sanity (19.5)\nInstall the tidyverse and here packages (19.6)\nCreate a R project using the MATH615 folder that you created in step 1. (ASCN 19.7)\n\nShut down R studio fully, navigate to your class folder, and open your project file (the cube) before you continue.\n\nRead through and follow the “Hello Quarto” tutorial (19.8 intro)\nInstall the tinytex program so you can create PDFs from your Quarto document. This is required (19.8)\n\nIf you have difficulty with any of this, visit Community Coding, my office hours, or post in Discord."
