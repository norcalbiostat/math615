You can address me as ‚ÄúRobin‚Äù, ‚ÄúDr.¬†D‚Äù, or some other respectful title such as ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù.\nI have a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA, but I‚Äôm a Chico alum. I double majored in Statistics & Biology, with minor in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started at Butte College.\nMy campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative (DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and off campus.\nI am also a research manager at the Center for Healthy communities. I help to manage their research and evaluation team.\nI have yet another hat as a PI for Project DA-FANH, a multi-campus collaboration whose goal is to retain and graduate highly qualified students while dismantling barriers and existing stereotypes. We aim to build a pathway for students of color in the intersection of Data Science/Data Analytics within food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences (FANH) careers. We run workshops and internships for both graduate and undergraduate students.\nWhen I‚Äôm not on campus, typically I‚Äôm growing food for my family, out adventuring with my dogs, or getting some game time in.\nYou can learn more about the work that I do on my website"

You are learning how to learn, how to look stuff up, how to do new things. You can‚Äôt learn all the things in 2 years.\n\nThere is an entire secton on the help page of the class website that is devoted to programming resources.\n\nAll my lecture notes use R. This entire website is built with R. R is a pioneer in generating reproducible and publishable quality reports.\n\nHere‚Äôs an student-generated example\n\nI will not dictate which software program you use in this class. Homework 0 has more information on the two historically popular programs for this class; SPSS and R.\nBut I will expect you to submit reproducible code. You can point and click your way to an answer, but code must be saved and reusable with minimal changes.\nBe open to new things, there is power in being polyglottal. You can use one language in here and another language for another class or project.\nYour professors in your other classes, or your masters committee may want you to learn a specific language. That should influence your choice.\n\nSo should your industry. Don‚Äôt make assumptions, look at job postings and see what they want.\nI.e. Center for Healthy Communities has a lot of Nutrition faculty/students. They‚Äôre solidly using R.\nPolitical Science & Economics often use Stata. I‚Äôve met Sociologists that use SAS, Stata, R and SPSS.\n\nI am fluent in SAS, STATA and R, reasonably read in SPSS but can provide limited support for Python.\nThe choice of software you use for this class is up to you, but you will be expected to learn how to navigate the programs outside of class time.\nI highly recommend making a habit to attend Community Coding even if it‚Äôs just to sit and do your work with your peers.\n\n\n\nüîó https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615 / Hello Math 615 Fall 22 cohort"
