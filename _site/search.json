This includes any necessary data preparation steps. Code that was ultimately not used in the final report should be excluded. To facilitate authoring manuscripts in the required style, we recommend using this Quarto template.\nManuscripts must be written in English using the Quarto R and text processing system. The journal Style Guide must be followed for formatting manuscripts. Only PDF and HTML files can be submitted. It is the responsibility of the authors to provide a submission in the appropriate format, paying very close attention to the style instructions. Manuscripts not meeting these requirements will be returned to the authors immediately."

These pages limits include the required figure(s) and table(s), but not references or acknowledgements.\n\n\nFont Size and Spacing\nUse a standard font size and any standard font. Articles should be single spaced.\n\n\nTitle and Author Information\nThe article should have an informative title. Additionally, author information should include:\n\nAuthor name\nAuthor degrees\nAuthor affiliation (e.g., BIOL MS Student, MSDSA Student, Center for Regenerative Agriculture, etc.)\n\n\n\nAbstract and Keywords\nA short abstract should describe the problem, data, and results.\nImmediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 5 keywords, avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, ‘and’, ‘of’). These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.\n\n\nArticle Body Structure\nArticles should follow a similar structure to that outlined below:\n\nIntroduction, Background\nStudy Design and Data collection\nData Preparation and Statistical Analysis Methods\nResults\nDiscussion, Conclusion\n\nNote, these exact names do not need to be used and can be customized to your given article, analysis, and context.\n\n\nTables and Figures\nA minimum of one table and one figure is required for all publications.\nAll tables and figures should be “publication ready” with informative titles, labels, and captions. Where applicable, units of measurement should be included. Variable names from code should be replaced with meaningful labels (e.g., instead of outcome_variable4 write the actual outcome).\nArticles must include a “Table 1” that describes the study population in a tabular format. Additional tables and figures may be included as necessary to present and summarize results. These count towards the page limit."

While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine dependence that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decided that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. Below I have added to my codebook variables reflecting smoking levels (e.g. smoking quantity and frequency). If my topic is too vague, I would like to bring suicide in. I would be interested to see if there is any relationship between level of smoking with nicotine dependence and suicide."

Before you start this assignment be sure to have read the article on “how to read a journal article”, and the lecture notes on “how to conduct a literature review”. This assignment will help you identify gaps in the current literature regarding your research topic, and refine your research question and set of potential variables substantially.\nYou need at least 3 primary source references that are directly related to your topic that were published in 2008 or more recent.\nFor each article, you will complete steps 1-3, in other words 3 times. There is an example at the bottom of this document.\n\nStep 1:\n\nPut the reference for the article in APA style. Here is a link to Purdue Owl APA style references that will guide you.\n\nNOTE: If you use a citation creator you still need to compare each part of all your references to make sure it was done correctly. The citation creator usually messes up on something.\nGood/suggested bibliography managers\n\nBibDesk (Mac) http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/\nZotero (in browser) https://www.zotero.org/\nMendeley (download) https://www.mendeley.com/\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\nRead an article, type up a brief summary (a few sentences) of what you learned about your topic from introduction/lit review and the discussion. This summary should convey the main themes and findings overall for the literature review and discussion in your own words.\n\n\nStep 3:\nThen explain how the article is going to help you with writing up your project. This is an explanation of what the article contributes to your project, not a restating of the summary. For example, is it going to help explain one or both of your topics, does it explain a key theory, what argument does it help you build for your project?\n\nLit review examples\n\nMy research question is: Is self-efficacy associated with parent relations and academic performance?\nWeiser, D. A., & Riggio, H. R. (2010). Family background and academic achievement: Does self-efficacy mediate outcomes? Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal, 13(3), 367-383.\n\nThis article discusses whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between family background and academic achievement. This is very similar to my topic but I feel that the component of mediation changes it slightly. I found that family predictors did not correlate with academic achievement as much as self-efficacy correlates with parent’s expectation of academic success. Self-efficacy is linked to grade point average and academic success expectations.\nThis information will be vital to understanding the extent to which self-efficacy is related to academic performance. With the correlation being weak for family background and academic performance, it will do less to determine the connection of parental relations to self-efficacy.\n\nTurner, E. A., Chandler, M., & Heffer, R. W. (2009). The influence of parenting styles, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy on academic performance in college students. Journal of College Student Development, 50(3), 337-346.\n\nThis study looks at how parenting styles, authoritative in particular, relate to academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation in college students. It claims that all factors, academic performance, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, are all influenced by authoritative parenting. What I learned about my topic is this study did find that self-efficacy was not significantly linked to authoritative parenting.\nThis article will help explain how this specific type of parenting, authoritative, has little affect of self-efficacy. It does not however, claim that parenting, as a whole has not effect on self-efficacy. This study does confirm that parenting does reflect on academic performance.\n\nJunttila, N., Vauras, M., & Laakkonen, E. (2007). The role of parenting self-efficacy in children’s social and academic behavior. European Journal of Psychology of Education, 22(1), 41-61.\n\nThis article looks at parenting self-efficacy. This is a little different from my topic but there are aspects of it that will be useful. It tested Finnish mothers and fathers to test for loneliness, parent self-efficacy, their child’s peer evaluated social competence, self-evaluated loneliness and academic skills. It found that parents loneliness reflected in their self-efficacy. The relationship between parent self-efficacy and the child’s academic achievement were evaluated through the child’s social competence. What I learned from this article that I can use is that parent’s self-efficacy can be reflected in the children.\nThis article is gong to help me tie in influences in the parent relations with the children to determine self-efficacy. This is an interesting perspective that wasn’t originally in my research question but I believe it will give valuable insight."

This assignment uses your chosen research data, and the variables that you chose in the last assignment when you created a personal research codebook. You will thoughtfully review the variables you are interested in, document which ones will need changed and how.\nAll raw data needs to stay raw, and all changes need to be documented. You will create a script/code file that will make all changes to the data in a programatically and reproducible way. You will create a single code file that imports your raw data, performs some data cleaning steps, and saves out an analysis ready data set that you will use throughout the semester.\nYou are not expected to have completed data management for every one of your variables under consideration by the submission date. I want to see a VERY good effort has been made (raw data read in, at least 2 quant and 2 cat variables dealt with, analysis data saved out.)\nCheck the rubric in Canvas for more grade specific details."

We can learn a lot by conducting exploratory data analysis, and if description is the goal then this is where your work can stop.\nHowever, if you want to make conclusions or inference about a relationship, then formal statistical analysis techniques are needed. We start here by formally testing if relationships or associations between two measures exist, then later will see how additional third variables can potentially disrupt or enhance any association that you may find.\n\n\n\nSubmission instructions\n\nUse the QMD template answer the questions.\nThis is a big assignment, so it will be broken into two stages.\n\nFirst draft will be on analyses 1-2, to make sure you are making correct progress.\nThe final version will Second draft will be on analyses 3-4.\nupload PDFs of your work to the assignment in Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevise between stages\n\n\n\nBefore you upload your final version check for comments on your prior analyses and make any suggested/recommended adjustments.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nIn this assignment you will practice FOUR(4) different types of bivariate analysis:\n\n(Q~B) Quantitative Outcome ~ Binary Categorical Explanatory == Two-sample t-tests for a difference in means\n(Q~C) Quantitative Outcome ~ Categorical Explanatory == ANOVA\n(B~C) Binary Outcome ~ Categorical (or Binary) Explanatory == \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test of Association.\n(Q~Q) Quantitative Outcome ~ Quantitative Explanatory == Linear regression analysis\n\nFor each analysis you will do the following steps:\n\nState which variable (including the variable name from your codebook) will be your explanatory variable and which will be your response variable.\n\nRemember, you have some variables in your codebook that can act as both categorical and quantitative.\nDecide which of those variables makes sense to “explain” the other.

Discussion\n\nHere you will explain what your graphical and inferential results tell you about your topic.\nDiscuss if your research hypothesis was supported, if it was not, why you think that might be\nExplain the overall story/trend/what you learned when you consider your univariate, bivariate & multivariate results about your topic.\nCompare your results to previous research results. Do they agree or disagree?\n\nSlide 19. Implications\n\nWhat are the practical implications of your results?\nWhat could others do with your findings?\nWhat future research needs to be conducted?\n\nThis needs to be more specific than “other variables could be explored”. Which variables and why? What other research articles indicate that those other variables are relevant?\n\n\nSlide 20. Limitations\n\nWho are the results of this study generalizable to? (i.e. a subset of individuals?)\nWere there any model assumptions that were not upheld?\nIf this is an observational study, you should make a statement about the findings are associations and not causal in nature\nAre there other factors that could explain your response variable that you did not include in your model?\n\nSlide 21. References\n\nYou can use smaller font to get all references on one slide.\nUse references from research plan, and any additional references gathered along the way.\nMake sure these are correctly done in APA format.\nProper citations for\n\nR: Type citation()\nR Studio\nHow to cite software in Text\n\n\n\n\nResearch Brief\n\nWrite the remaining sections of the manuscript: Data Preparation and Statistical Analysis Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusion.\nSubmit a PDF to Canvas and print a copy for your instructor by the due date.\n\n\n\n\nStage 6: Dissemination\n\nResearch Poster\n\nYou will transfer all findings into a research poster, print the poster, and then present your research to your classmates during our class final period in a poster symposium format.\nFull guidelines including examples and evaluation criteria are written in this blog post.\nSubmit the poster file as printed to Canvas by the due date.\n\nDraft version\nThis draft is graded based on how complete the poster is. You should consider this a draft that you would circulate to your colleagues for final review and comments.

Then we load the dataset itself using data(\"penguins\"). We check the current levels of the island factor using levels(penguins$island).\nNext, we use the factor() function to reorder the levels of the island variable. We specify the desired order of levels using the levels argument. In this case, we put “Dream” first, followed by the other islands. Finally, we check the new order of levels to make sure the change was successful.\nMake sure you have the palmerpenguins package installed. You can install it using install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\") if you haven’t done so already."

Students practice cleaning and manipulating data, creating data visualizations, and conducting introductory level statistical analysis using real-world data sets that are relevant to their field. Analysis topics include single and two-sample inference, analysis of variance, multiple regression, analysis of co-variance, experimental design, repeated measures, nonparametric procedures, and categorical data analysis. Reproducible research is strongly emphasized through the use of statistical computing software (e.g. SPSS, Stata, SAS, R, Python).

Here is how I check in on your progress throughout the semester\n\nQuizzes on the current or prior content. Quizzes are a great way to test yourself, enhance recall, and self-assess your comprehension of the subject. Quizzes are administered in Google Forms, and done in two parts.\n\nIndividual: First try to answer as many questions without looking at your notes. Then use your notes to answer the rest.\nGroup: After the individual quiz closes I will choose 1-4 questions that scored the lowest. We will do a class-wide discussion of those topics, then you will work in groups to redo the selected questions for half credit.\n\nAssignments This is your testing ground, your first round of practice. Can you take what you learned and apply it to a data set. Graded on completeness and effort.\nPeer reviews Helping others enhances your own understanding.\nProject Can you weave together data and story to do research? This is your second round of practice. Your work should be more polished than in your homework, and I will be grading them in more detail and using a rubric.\nComprehensive Final Exam Can you identify and apply correct statistical theory to new situations?"

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\n\nLet me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\nIf you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\nAdapted from Monica Linden at Brown University.\nFurthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries."

However, I want to stress that, AI programs are not a replacement for human creativity, originality, and critical thinking. Writing (text and code) is a skill that you must nurture over time in order to develop your own individual voice, style, and view.\nThe use of chat GPT is allowed/encouraged to help you learn how to code but all code used must be fully explained in text. We will cover what this means and how to do this when we start data management around week 3. How ChatGPT can help you write code\nYou are responsible for fact checking the accuracy of statements composed by AI language models. These models are known to produce bullshit responses. And yes, this is a technical term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe up front!\n\n\n\nWhen presenting text written by Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, you must include an appropriate citation. https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt\nThis also goes for when you have it write code for you.

    "text": "Preparation\nIn Homework 00 you downloaded and installed R and R Studio, and used it to import a data file in Homework 01. There are a few more steps to take that will allow you to be best setup for using R to analyze data.\nFollow the instructions in the Appendix of the Applied Stats Course Notes to do the following:\n\nSet preferences for sanity (19.5)\nInstall the tidyverse and here packages (19.6)\nCreate a R project using the MATH615 folder that you created in step 1. (ASCN 19.7)\n\nShut down R studio fully, navigate to your class folder, and open your project file (the cube) before you continue.\n\nRead through and follow the “Hello Quarto” tutorial (19.8 intro)\nInstall the tinytex program so you can create PDFs from your Quarto document. This is required (19.8)\n\nIf you have difficulty with any of this, visit Community Coding, my office hours, or post in Discord."

If you are rusty on descriptive statistics such as mean, median, skewness, standard deviation and variance, how to read boxplots, histograms and the IQR rule then I highly recommend that you review IMS Chapter 5.\nThe quiz for this topic includes topics that are not directly lectured on but are considered critical knowledge and are included in either PMA6 Ch 4 or IMS Ch 5."
