This assignment uses your chosen research data, and the variables that you chose in the last assignment when you created a personal research codebook. You will thoughtfully review the variables you are interested in, document which ones will need changed and how.\n\nAll raw data needs to stay raw, and all changes need to be documented. You will create a script/code file that will make all changes to the data in a programatically and reproducible way. You will create a single code file that imports your raw data, performs some data cleaning steps, and saves out an analysis ready data set that you will use throughout the semester. \n\nYou are **not** expected to have completed data management for every one of your variables under consideration by the submission date. \nI want to see a VERY good effort has been made (raw data read in, at least 2 quant and 2 cat variables dealt with, analysis data saved out.)\n\nCheck the rubric in Canvas for more grade specific details. \n\n----\n\n# Instructions \n\n1. Create a new script file named `dm_dataname_username.qmd` (e.g. `dm_addhealth_rdonatello.qmd`)\n    - Make sure this is your **math615/script** folder, and your data is in your **math615/data** folder\n2. After you load the data, restrict the variables to only the ones you are investigating using the `select` function from the `dplyr` package. \n3. Explore and clean at least 2 categorical and 2 numeric variables. One by one, check each variable for necessary adjustments. Complete each of the following steps for each variable.\n    - First explain in English what the variable name is and what it measures. \n    - Then examine the variable using the `table()`, `summary()` and `hist()` functions. \n    - Identify the data type of the variable using the `class()` or `typeof()` functions. Ask (and answer) the question \"Does this match with the intended data type?\" \n    - Recode the data as necessary \n    - Always confirm your recodes worked as intended by creating another table or summary. \n4. Save the resulting data set to your `data` folder as `datasetname_clean.Rdata`, e.g. `addhealth_clean.Rdata` using the `save()` function \n\n\nReference [lec03b-data_prep](../slides/lec03b-data_prep.html) and [ASCN Chapter 1](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/) on how you can explore your data and start to make data edits using R. \n\n----\n\n# Submission instructions\n\n* You will submit your code file to Canvas. This must run on my computer. \n    * What comes out is what I grade. \n    * Render your script file to PDF before you submit to ensure that it works and looks the way you expect it to. \n\n> Exceptions: If you are working on a personal data set then you must submit a PDF to Canvas demonstrating reproducibility. If there are questions I may ask you to demonstrate your code to me in person. \n\n<!---\n### Draft\n\nUpload your <span style=\"color:red\">PDF</span> file to the `03 Data Management` folder in Google Drive. \n\n* R users compile your `qmd` file to create a PDF (render to PDF)\n* SPSS users will have to present additional output to demonstrate that the recodes were successful. \n    - Include the `FREQUENCIES` code in your `dm` file to create tables or summaries of the modified variables, so that it shows up in your output window. \n    - After you are done, close & restart SPSS by opening your `dm` file. Click \"Run all\" \n    - Export your **output** file as PDF and upload it to Google Drive\n\n### Peer Review instructions\n\nAs a reviewer, this is what you're checking for: \n\n* Check that they have 2 quantitative and 2 categorical variables present\n* Did they check for missing, out of range values? \n* Did they present some sort of proof that a certain recode worked as intended? \n* Does their work appear to be reproducible? \n\n\n--->\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n# Example\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\nHere is an example using R Markdown/Quarto. Everything you see below this line comes is written in the `.qmd` script itself. This is an example of literate programming where you write what you are going to do, do it in code, and then write what you have learned after each step.\n:::\n\n \n\n\n## Setup\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Read in the data \nraw <- read.delim(\"https://norcalbiostat.netlify.app/data/Depress.txt\", \n                  sep=\"\\t\",  header=TRUE) %>%\n  # convert all variable names to lowercase\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\n# Select only the variables that I am interested in\nmydata  <- raw %>% select(age, marital, cesd, health)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### General Health\n\nThe variable `health` records a persons perceived general health as being either Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor. This is considered an ordinal categorical variable. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(mydata$health)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n  1   2   3   4 \n130 115  35  14 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(mydata$health)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"integer\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe variable `health` currently is an integer with numeric values 1-4, but the codebook states that this is a categorical variable where 1=Excellent, 2=Good, 3=Fair, 4=Poor. \nSo I need to convert this numeric variable to a factor variable. There are no values outside the 1-4 range, such as a -9 that codes for missing data so I do not need to make any further adjustments (You want to code out missing before you convert variables to factors)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmydata$health_cat <- factor(mydata$health, labels=c(\"Excellent\", \"Good\", \"Fair\", \"Poor\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nI will confirm that the recode worked by making a two-way `table`\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(mydata$health, mydata$health_cat, useNA=\"always\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      \n       Excellent Good Fair Poor <NA>\n  1          130    0    0    0    0\n  2            0  115    0    0    0\n  3            0    0   35    0    0\n  4            0    0    0   14    0\n  <NA>         0    0    0    0    0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThis shows that all 1's are now 'excellent', 4's are now 'poor' and so forth. \n\n### CESD\nThe numeric variable `CESD` represents the depression index scale, which is a sum of 20 component variables. A high score indicates a person who is depressed, with 16 being the typical cutoff for creating a binary indicator of depression.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(mydata$cesd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.
