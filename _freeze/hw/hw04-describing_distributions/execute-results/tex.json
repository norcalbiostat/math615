You will create a plot, follow up each graphic with a table of summary statistics (for quantitative variables) or frequency and proportion table (for categorical), and then a summary paragraph that brings it all together. \n\n----\n\n# Instructions \n\n\n**PART 1**: Completely describe 2 categorical and 2 quantitative variables using all of the following: \n\n* An explanation of what the variable is, and how it is measured. \n* A table of summary statistics,\n* An appropriate plot with titles and axes labels (include both a histogram and boxplot for numeric data)\n* A short paragraph description in full complete English sentences. \n    \n**PART 2**: Create an all-inclusive summary table using the `tbl_summary()` function inside the `gtsummary` package. See slide 10 in the lec04 notes or the [`gtsummary` tutorial](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html). Include all 4 variables that were analyzed as part of this assignment. \n\n\n\n\nTo guide your description of this distribution try to include the following information:\n\n* What is the trend in the data? What exactly does the chart show? (Use the chart title to help you answer this question)\n* Describe the location of the bulk of the data. Measures include\n    - Measures of center: mean/median\n    - IQR as Q3 and Q1 (i.e., 50% of the data lie between $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$)\n    - N and (%) for categorical data for the largest category. \n* Describe the shape (for quantitative measures only):\n    - Symmetry/Skewness - Is it symmetric, skewed right, or skewed left?\n    - Modality - Is it uniform, unimodal, or bimodal?       \n* Describe the spread or variability in the data\n    - Appropriate measures include range, standard deviation, IQR for continuous data\n    - For categorical data describe if distribution is spread across multiple response categories or mainly only one.\n* Describe the outliers (note: there may not be any for every graph). Continuous data only.\n    - Are there any outliers for the variable?\n    - If yes, are these true outliers or false (due to data management or input error) outliers? \n    (This could alert you to missing codes like -77 or 99 that need to be set to missing)\n\n----\n\n# Submission instructions\n\n* Use the template provided: [[QMD]](_templates/hw04_describing_distributions_template.qmd)\n  - Right click and 'save as', put this in your `scripts` folder\n* Upload your draft PDF to Canvas by the due date. \n\n\n\n----\n\n\\newpage \n\n# Example - Part I\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(gtsummary)\n\nload(here::here(\"data/depression_clean.Rdata\")) # your import line will look something like this\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n> The `depressed` variable is an indicator variable created from the CESD scale to identify potential clinical depression.
