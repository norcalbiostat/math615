You will create a plot, follow up each graphic with a table of summary statistics (for quantitative variables) or frequency and proportion table (for categorical), and then a summary paragraph that brings it all together. \n\n----\n\n# Instructions \n\n\nCompletely describe 2 categorical and 2 quantitative variables using all of the following: \n\n* An explanation of what the variable is, and how it is measured. \n* A table of summary statistics,\n* An appropriate plot with titles and axes labels, \n* A short paragraph description in full complete English sentences. \n    \n    \nTo guide your description of this distribution try to include the following information:\n\n* What is the trend in the data? What exactly does the chart show? (Use the chart title to help you answer this question)\n* Describe the location of the bulk of the data. Measures include\n    - Measures of center: mean/median\n    - IQR as Q3 and Q1 (i.e., 50% of the data lie between $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$)\n    - N and (%) for categorical data for the largest category. \n* Describe the shape (for quantitative measures only):\n    - Symmetry/Skewness - Is it symmetric, skewed right, or skewed left?\n    - Modality - Is it uniform, unimodal, or bimodal?       \n* Describe the spread or variability in the data\n    - Appropriate measures include range, standard deviation, IQR for continuous data\n    - For categorical data describe if distribution is spread across multiple response categories or mainly only one.\n* Describe the outliers (note: there may not be any for every graph). Continuous data only.\n    - Are there any outliers for the variable?\n    - If yes, are these true outliers or false (due to data management or input error) outliers? \n    (This could alert you to missing codes like -77 or 99 that need to be set to missing)\n\n----\n\n# Submission instructions\n\n* Use the template provided: [[QMD]](_templates/hw04_describing_distributions_template.qmd)\n  - Right click and 'save as', put this in your `scripts` folder\n* Upload your draft PDF to Canvas by the due date\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\\newpage \n\n# Example\nThis example uses the `mpg` data set from the `ggplot2` package.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(sjPlot); library(ggplot2);library(ggpubr)\n\n# Import data\n# load(here(\"data\", \"data.Rdata\")) # your import line will look something like this\n```\n:::\n\n\n> text written like this are example student submission text\n\n## Basic categorical\nDraft style plot, direct computer output showing/copied.

Explained what the variable was named and what it measured. \n\n> The `class` variable from the `mpg` data set is a catgorical variable that describes the type of vehicle being measured. Some levels of this categorical variable include _compact_, _pickup_ and _suv_. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_frq(mpg$class)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw04-describing_distributions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Sub compact cars are the most frequently reported type of car, making up over one-quarter (26.5%) of the cars in this data set with n=62 cars represented.
