The results from the first 30 days of this study are summarized in the following table.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           \n            no event stroke Sum\n  control        214     13 227\n  treatment      191     33 224\n  Sum            405     46 451\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           \n            no event stroke\n  control       0.94   0.06\n  treatment     0.85   0.15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThese results are surprising! The point estimate suggests that patients who received stents may have a higher risk of stroke: $p_{trmt}âˆ’p_{ctrl}=0.090$.\n\n## Point estimate vs Interval estimate\n\nThe point estimate for the difference in proportions $p_{trmt}âˆ’p_{ctrl}=0.090$ is a single point estimate, based on this single sample.\n\n\\\n\nA *point estimate* is our best guess for the value of the parameter, so it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value.\n\n## Constructing a 95% confidence interval (CI)\n\nWhen the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of interest about 95% of the time. Thus, a 95% confidence interval for such a point estimate can be constructed:\n\n\n$$\\mbox{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 Ã— SE$$\n\n\nWe can be 95% confident this interval captures the true value.\n\n## Construct a 95% CI for the stent example\n\nThe conditions necessary to ensure the point estimate $p_{trmt}âˆ’p_{ctrl}$ is nearly normal have been verified for you, and the estimate's standard error is $SE = 0.028$.\n\n* Construct a 95% confidence interval for the change in 30-day stroke rates from usage of the stent.\n* Interpret this interval in context of the problem. \n\n## Answer: \n\n\n$$0.090 \\pm 1.96Ã—0.028 = (0.035,0.145)$$\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that implanting a stent in a stroke patientâ€™s brain increased the risk of stroke within 30 days by a rate of 0.035 to 0.145. \n\n## Important note\n\n:warning: it's incorrect to say that we can be 95% confident that the true value is inside the mean. \n\n![Figure 13.11: Twenty-five samples of size n=300 were collected from a population with p=0.30. For each sample, a confidence interval was created to try to capture the true proportion p. However, 1 of these 25 intervals did not capture p=0.30.](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/95PercentConfidenceInterval-1.png)\n\n## \n\n* This is one of the most common errors: while it might be useful to think of it as a probability, the confidence level only quantifies how plausible it is that the parameter is in the interval.\n* Our intervals say nothing about the confidence of capturing individual observations, a proportion of the observations, or about capturing point estimates. \n* Confidence intervals provide an interval estimate for and attempt to capture population parameters.\n\n# Hypothesis Testing\n\n![https://xkcd.com/1478/](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/p_values.png)\n\n##  Return to the collaborative notes.\n\n\n[https://hackmd.io/@norcalbiostat/07-intro_inference](https://hackmd.io/@norcalbiostat/07-intro_inference)\n\n\n\n\n## Using Confidence Intervals to test a hypothesis\n\nThis confidence interval can also be used in a way analogous to a hypothesis test: since the interval does not contain 0 (is completely above 0), it means the data provide convincing evidence that the stent used in the study changed the risk of stroke within 30 days\n\n\n\n",
