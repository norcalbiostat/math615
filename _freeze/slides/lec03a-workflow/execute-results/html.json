To say that 70% of any analysis is spent on the data management stage is not an understatement.\n\n## \n\n![Example workflow](images/Afifi_Fig3_1.png)\n\n## Generating a reproducible workflows\n\nReproducibility is the ability for any researcher to take the same data set and run the same set of software program instructions as another researcher and achieve the same results.\n\n*Not the same as **replicability** where you re-run an experiment and achieve the same outcomes.*\n\nThe goal is to create an exact record of what was done to a data set to produce a specific result.\n\n## Three steps to achieve reproducibility\n\n1.  The un-processed data are connected directly to software code file(s) that perform data preparation techniques.\n2.  The processed data are connected directly to other software code file(s) that perform the analyses.\n3.  All data and code files are self-contained such that they could be given to another researcher to execute the code commands on a separate computer and achieve the same results as the original author.\n\n## \n\n![Figure Credits: [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/)](images/pipeline.png){width=\"620\"}\n\n## Literate programming\n\n-   Explain the logic of the program or analysis process in a natural language,\n-   Small code snippets included at each step act as a full set of instructions that can be executed to reproduce the result/analysis being discussed.\n-   Literate programming tools such as Markdown and $\\LaTeX$ are integrated into all common statistical packages except SPSS.\n\n> [Example Quarto Document](https://quarto.org/)\n\n## Reproducible Research + Literate Programming {.smaller}\n\n-   Practicing reproducible research techniques using literate programming tools allows such major updates to be a simple matter of re-compiling all coded instructions using the updated data set.\n-   The effort then is reduced to a careful review and update of any written results.\n-   Using literate programming tools create formatted documents in a streamlined manner that is fully synchronized with the code itself.\n-   The author writes the text explanations, interpretations, and code in the statistical software program itself, and the program will execute all commands and combine the text, code and output all together into a final dynamic document.\n\n## Why all the fuss? \n\n-   You are your own collaborator 6 months from now. Be nice to your future self\n-   Explain your steps (the WHY more than the what)\n    -   How did you get from point A to B?\n    -   Why did you recode this variable in this manner?\n-   Found an error in your analysis code? Need to add an analysis to your presentation?\n-   Reproduce your steps in a few clicks using a script file (`.R`, `.Rmd`, `.sas`, `.sps`, `.do`, `.ipynb`)\n\n\n## Data Analysis Pipeline\n\n[![In this model of the data science process, you start with data import and tidying. Next, you understand your data with an iterative cycle of transforming, visualizing, and modeling. You finish the process by communicating your results to other humans. Ref R for Data Science 2nd ed](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/571b056757d68e6df81a3e3853f54d3c76ad6efc/32d37/diagrams/data-science.png){fig-alt=\"A line diagram of figure 1.1 from the book R for Data science\" width=\"682\"}](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro)\n\nRegardless of the programming language you choose to use, using scripts will make this process reproducible and more powerful with less pain points.\n\n## Quarto as an end-to-end solution\n\n* https://quarto.org/\n* Supports R, Python, Observable and Julia\n* \"Next Generation\" R Markdown files\n* Publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.\n* Write using Pandoc markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.\n\n\n\n",
