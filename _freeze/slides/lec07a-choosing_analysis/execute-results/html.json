To minimize the unexplained, or `residual` error.\n\n## Which model to use?\n\nMoving from:\n\n> \"What descriptive measures should be used to examine the data\"\n\nto\n\n> \"What statistical analyses should be performed?\n\n\\\n\n\n\n## Choosing Appropriate Analysis {.smaller}\n\nThis table shows which statistical analyses procedures are appropriate depending on the combination of explanatory (rows) and response (columns) variable. \n\n\n| Exp \\\\ Resp      | Binary              | **Categorical**                     | **Quantitative**                |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Binary**       | Chi-squared         | Chi-squared                         | T-Test, Linear Regression       |\n| **Categorical**  | Chi-squared         | Chi-squared                         | ANOVA, Linear Regression        |\n| **Quantitative** | Logistic Regression | *Multinomial or Ordinal Regression* | Correlation & Linear Regression |\n\n\nSee Table 6.2 in PMA6 for a more detailed table. \n\n## Why selection can be difficult\n\n::: incremental\n-   Classroom instruction tends to present methods in logical order from a learning perspective. Building from simple to more complex. Exposure to complex models limited.\n-   Real life data often contain a mixture of data types, missing data and complex patterns. This can make the choice of analysis somewhat arbitrary at times.\n-   Two trained statisticians presented with the same data will often approach the analysis from different perspectives, and may different analyses depending on what assumptions they are willing to make.\n:::\n\n## Not always clear {.smaller}\n\n-   The primary assumption of most standard statistical procedures is that the records are independent of each other.\n-   Often program evaluation relies on paired measurements before and after a certain exposure or treatment (pre-post).\n    -   In this case, the approach is to calculate a pairwise difference for each individual and compare the average difference to 0 (any change vs no change).\n-   For the purposes of this class, we will only concern ourselves with independent groups.\n\nRepeated measures is a topic typically taught in MATH 456 (but also covered in Chapter 18 of PMA6)\n\n## Everything is a linear model\n\n* Most of the common statistical tests (including the ones we cover) are special cases of linear regression\n\n* [https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)\n\n## Additional References\n\nPMA6 does not go over T-test, ANOVA or $\\chi^{2}$ tests.
