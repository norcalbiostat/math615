No\nintervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and\nwe'll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year\nperiod.\n\n## Results from study\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|          | Alive| Dead|   Sum|\n|:---------|-----:|----:|-----:|\n|Control   | 44405|  505| 44910|\n|Mammogram | 44425|  500| 44925|\n|Sum       | 88830| 1005| 89835|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe explanatory variable is treatment (additional mammograms), and the response variable is death from breast cancer. \n\nAre these measures associated?\n\n## Assume independence/no association {.smaller .incremental}\n\n-   If mammograms are more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer\n    exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast\n    cancer in the control group (there is a relationship).\n-   If mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams,\n    we would expect to see no difference in breast cancer deaths in the\n    two groups (there is no relationship).\n-   Need to figure out how many deaths would be **expected**, if there\n    was no relationship between treatment death by breast cancer,\n-   Then examine the **residuals** - the difference between the observed\n    counts and the expected counts in each cell.\n\n## Table notation\n\nTables can be described by $i$ rows and $j$ columns.

In this case we generalize the statement to ask: **Is the distribution of 1 variable the same across levels of another variable?**. In this sense, it is very much like an ANOVA.\n\nMathematically the $\\chi^{2}$ test of association is the exact same as a test of equal proportions.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between a person's income and perceived level of general health.\n\nThe categorical explanatory variable is income, binned into 4 ranges\n(`income_cat`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naddhealth$income_cat <- Hmisc::cut2(addhealth$income, g = 4)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Visualize and summarize {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_xtab(grp=addhealth$income_cat,\n                  x=addhealth$genhealth, \n                  show.total = FALSE, margin=\"row\",\n                  legend.title=\"\") + \n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec07d-chi_squared_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe income distribution is nearly flat for who rate themselves\nin excellent or very good condition.
