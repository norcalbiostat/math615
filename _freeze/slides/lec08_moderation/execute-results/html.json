This is the unique and powerful feature of stratified models. The downside is that each model is only fit on the amount of data in that particular subset. Furthermore, each model has 3 parameters that need to be estimated: $\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}$, and $\\sigma^{2}$, for a total of 9 for the three models. The more parameters that need to be estimated, the more data we need.\n\n# Identifying a Moderator\n\nWhen testing a potential moderator, we are asking the question whether there is an association between two constructs, **but separately for different subgroups within the sample.** - This is also called a *stratified* model, or a *subgroup analysis*.\n",
