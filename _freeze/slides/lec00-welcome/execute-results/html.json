I double majored in Statistics & Biology, with minor in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started at Butte College.\n\nMy campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner, leading the Data Science Initiative (DSI) provide training and experiences for students and faculty, and providing analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and off campus.\n\nWhen I'm not on campus, typically I'm growing food for my family, out adventuring with my dogs, or getting some game time in. You can learn more about the projects i'm involved in on my [website](http://www.norcalbiostat.com/).\n\n## Your turn\n\n-   Turn to your neighbor and introduce yourself.\n-   You'll post an introduction in Discord this week so everyone will get to know everyone else.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\n## Everyone is welcome here\n\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.\n\nIt is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.\n\n## Supportive Learning Environment\n\nI would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.)\n\n## To help accomplish this:\n\n-   Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records.\n-   Help me pronounce your name as accurately as possible. Corrections are welcome.\n-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you.\n\n# What is this class about?\n\n## Learning goals {.smaller}\n\n::: incremental\n-   Developing the skills to conduct statistically valid and reproducible research.\n-   Understanding how data needs to be structured and formatted for analysis, so you can better prepare data collection methods for future research.\n-   Practicing the skills to be the boss of your own data without relying on others to \"run the numbers\" for you.\n-   Learning basic statistical techniques for a small selection of analysis situations.\n-   Learning how to do all of this in a reproducible manner to save you headache and time during your research.\n-   Laying the statistical foundation so you can learn to apply more advanced statistical models as needed, such as those covered in Applied Statistics II (Math 456).\n\nSee the [syllabus](../syllabus.html) for more detailed learning objectives.\n:::\n\n# How are we going to accomplish all that?\n\n## Lots of course materials and tools\n\n-   I don't sanitize this class for you by keeping everything in a learning management system like Canvas.\n\n-   In a working environment you have to deal with multiple platforms, multiple accounts and manage multiple locations for files and content. I use the best tools for the job.\n\n-   Homework 0 provides a checklist for getting connected and testing out your tools.\n\n## Class website\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n\nhttps://math615.netlify.app/\n\n-   Bookmark this page. You will be here a lot.\n-   Contains details on weekly topics, links to notes, assignments and additional materials\n-   Sometimes links will be broken. Typo's happen. Notify me via Discord and I'll get to it asap.\n\n## Textbook\n\n-   The textbook is used for reading and learning content at a more in depth level than my overview slides.\n-   This will be used in Math 456, and is an excellent reference guide.\n-   If you're curious, I get about 1% of the sale in royalty. The income is *not* why I collaborated on this edition. I used the 4th edition in grad school and really like teaching out of it.\n\n## Canvas\n\n-   Assignment submission\n-   Grades\n-   Schedule & Due dates\n-   Recorded lectures\n\n## Google Drive\n\n-   Collaborative note taking\n-   Quizzes (Individual, and Group)\n-   Ongoing research project work\n\n## Discord\n\n-   Used for outside class discussions, meme sharing, homework help and general chatter.\n- Your first place to ask code and homework based questions\n-   I will not answer most class-content based questions through email.\n-   Download either the phone app or the desktop app (I use both). This is mandatory.\n    -   Do not rely on remembering to log in via the web browser. You will miss important notifications.\n\n## Lecture notes (slides)\n\n-   Stand alone lecture notes like these.\n-   Click on three lines in the bottom left to see options for exporting a copy in other formats. \n\n## Video\n\n-   Posted in Canvas\n-   Occasional pre-class learning content\n-   I will also record most class sessions\n\n\n# Research Project\n\n## Project Overview\n\n-   Semester long project\n-   Co-authored research project with regular peer review\n-   All regular assignments are designed to support your research.\n-   Your choice (within guidelines) of research topic and data set.\n-   End goal is a research poster presentation and research brief.\n\n\n# Data Analysis Software\n\n## Welcome to modern Statistics & Data Analysis {.smaller}\n\n::: incremental\n-   No more TI-83, modern statistics is computational based.\n    -   And I don't mean Excel.\n-   Big push for open research in the Natural and Social Sciences.\n    -   Sharing code & data. Sometimes required along with manuscript for publishing.\n-   Reproducibility. Give someone else access to your data and code, and they can replicate your findings.\n    -   We will practice this every day in this class.\n-   I'm not the only one [teaching reproducible research](http://benmarwick.github.io/UW-eScience-reproducibility-social-sciences/#/).\n-   Expect to bring your laptop every day to class.\n:::\n\n## Required Software\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/Rlogo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75\"}\n\n-   The programming language R (syntax)\n-   Community written packages containing functions to do cool things\n-   Not used by itself *in this class*\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/RStudio.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75\"}\n\n-   RStudio is the supportive working environment\n-   Integrates with other tools such as Quarto, HTML and Python\n-   R is accessed *from within* R Studio\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Policies\n\n## Mode of Instruction / Attendance\n\n-   This is an in person class. Attendance is expected\n-   This is a graduate class and you all are adults with lives outside this class.\n-   Each class session will be live streamed, with the recording posted to Canvas within a few days.\n-   Common reasons to join the class virtually:\n    -   you're sick\n    -   you're out of town on field work\n\n\n## Collaboration & Plagerism {.smaller}\n\nCollaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts and debugging with. However your submitted work must represent **your personal effort** on all parts. \n\n-   Collaboration on exams and individual quizzes is not allowed.\n-   You can use ChatGPT/AI tools **to help you learn**, but you must disclose when you do.\n-   Your work must be your own. \n\nSee the syllabus for details on acceptable uses of collaboration.\n\n## Time Commitment\n\n-   Expect to spend 10-12 hours each week on this class.\n    -   Note that this is 1-2 hours more than an undergraduate 3 unit course would take (9 hrs). This is to acknowledge that it may take you longer than expected to complete the work until you gain practice coding.\n-   I will do my best not to move due dates so you can plan accordingly.\n-   Use the calendar in Canvas\n\n\n## Syllabus\n\nThis overview is not a replacement for reading the syllabus. That document contains more information on policies and procedures that you need to be aware of. You can access an HTML version on the course website in the navigation bar, and a PDF version from inside Canvas.\n\n# Questions?\n",
