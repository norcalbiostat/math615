You will be here a lot.\n-   Contains details on weekly topics, links to notes, assignments and additional materials\n-   Sometimes links will be broken. Typo's happen. Notify me via Discord and I'll get to it asap.\n\n## Class Website - Topic view\n\n* One page per Topic\n* These correspond to Modules in Canvas\n* Ties together what we have learned, with what we are going to learn\n* States the learning objectives for that topic\n* Links to all learning and assessment materials for this topic\n* **MAIN PLACE FOR LINKS** I don't like to put links in multiple places because if I make an update then I have to remember to update all places, and that is error prone. \n\n## Class Website - Other tabs\n\n* All slides, all homework\n* Project overview & information\n* Syllabus, help\n* Reference materials\n\n## Practical Multivariate Analysis - 6th Edition\n\n-   The textbook is used for reading and learning content at a more in depth level than my overview slides.\n-   This will be used in Math 456, and is an excellent reference guide for further learning. \n-   If you're curious, Afifi is a mentor of mine and invited me to participate. I used the 4th edition in grad school and really like teaching out of it. Royalties are about $100/year and is *not* why I require this text. \n\n## Canvas\n\n-   Assignment submission\n-   Grades\n-   Schedule, calendar, Due dates\n-   Recorded lectures\n\n## Google Drive\n\n-   Collaborative note taking\n-   Quizzes (Individual, and Group)\n-   Ongoing research project work\n\n## Discord\n\n-   Used for outside class discussions, meme sharing, homework help and general chatter.\n- Your first place to ask code and homework based questions\n-   I will not answer most class-content based questions through email.\n-   Download either the phone app or the desktop app (I use both). This is mandatory.\n    -   Do not rely on remembering to log in via the web browser. You will miss important notifications.\n\n## Lecture notes (slides)\n\n-   Stand alone lecture notes like these.\n-   Click on three lines in the bottom left to see options for exporting a copy in other formats. \n\n## Video\n\n-   Posted in Canvas\n-   Occasional pre-class learning content\n-   I will also record most class sessions\n\n## Statistcal Analysis Software\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/Rlogo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75\"}\n\n-   The programming language R (syntax)\n-   Community written packages containing functions to do cool things\n-   Not used by itself *in this class*\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/RStudio.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"75\"}\n\n-   RStudio is the supportive working environment\n-   Integrates with other tools such as Quarto, HTML and Python\n-   R is accessed *from within* R Studio\n:::\n:::\n\nYou will download and install both as part of homework 0. \n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\n* It may seem like a lot in the first week or two\n* You will get used to it if you embrace it and view it as a learning opportunity\n* If you fight it because it's not what you're used to, or are upset because there are \"too many places to look\", you are not in for a fun semester. \n* I am open to _constructive_ feedback about course material. \n",
