Set preferences for sanity (19.5)\n2. Install the `tidyverse` and `here` packages (19.6)\n3. Create a R project using the `MATH615` folder that you created in step 1. (ASCN 19.7)\n   - Shut down R studio fully, navigate to your class folder, and open your project file (the cube) before you continue. \n4. Read through and follow the [\"Hello Quarto\" tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio) (19.8 intro)\n7. Install the `tinytex` program so you can [create PDFs](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/literate-programming-with-quarto.html#creating-pdfs) from your Quarto document. This is required (19.8)\n\nIf you have difficulty with any of this, visit Community Coding, my office hours, or post in Discord. \n\n## Learning Materials\n\n{{< fa person-chalkboard >}}  **Slides (Will open in full screen.
