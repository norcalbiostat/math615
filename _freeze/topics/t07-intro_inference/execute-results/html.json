You have until the date on the calendar to take these quizzes. You can repeat them as many times as you like until you get the grade you are happy with. \n\nNote: Some questions require manual review (because they are written answers). I will check nightly for new responses and do the manual grading so you can see your score. \n\nQuantifying Uncertainty: https://forms.gle/PQGYizu45bCSoQAM9\nFoundations for Inference: https://forms.gle/a4tEWsRf1nxkoz3P6 \n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n* _NA_\n\n<!-- end of list -->\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nAdditional videos that may be helpful. \n\n* [What is a sampling distribution](https://youtu.be/xGVzHxFnaiA)\n* [Sampling Distributions: Introduction to the concept](https://youtu.be/Zbw-YvELsaM)\n",
