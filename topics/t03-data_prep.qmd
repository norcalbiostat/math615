## Learning Path

### Where we've been
Learning how to read our data and ask questions that are potentially answerable with this data. 

### Where we're at
* Starting to write code.
* Recognizing that this stage will take time and that you are learning something challenging.
* Willing to ask for help and collaboration

### Objectives

```{r}
pander(str_prep(topic_mats$topic_obj))
```

## Preparation 

1. Create a `MATH615` folder on your computer in an easy to find place. 
    - Create (at least) following subfolders: `data`, `scripts`
    - Download your projct data and codebook into the `data` subfolder. 
2. Follow the instructions in the Appendix of the [Applied Stats Course Notes](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/setup_intro.html) to do the next steps
3. Install R and R Studio
4. Install the `tidyverse` and `here` packages
5. Create a R project using the `MATH615` folder that you created in step 1. 
6. Read through and follow the ["Hello Quarto" tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio)
7. Go back to the ASCN Appendix and follow the instructions on [how to create PDFs](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/literate-programming-with-quarto.html#creating-pdfs) from your Quarto document. 

If you have difficulty with any of this, visit Community Coding or my office hours.
