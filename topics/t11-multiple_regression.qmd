## Learning Path

### Where we've been
* Learning how to choose and implement an appropriate bivariate analyses, including building simple regression models.  
* Learning how a bivariate relationship can be altered or changed by the presence of a third variable. 

### Where we're at
Ready to learn how to expand regression models to include information contained in other variables. 


### Objectives

```{r}
pander(topic_mats$topic_obj)
```


## Learning Materials

:books:  **Reading** 

```{r}
pander(str_prep(topic_mats$reading))
```

## Assignment


```{r}
pander(str_prep(topic_mats$assignment))
```
